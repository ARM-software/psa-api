## Reference header files

Reference header files for each minor version of each API are provided in the [headers/](headers) folder.

## Test Suite

Test suites are available to validate compliance of API implementations against the specifications for Crypto, Attestation, and Secure Storage APIs, from:
[github.com/ARM-software/psa-arch-tests](https://github.com/ARM-software/psa-arch-tests)

Compliance badges can be obtained from [PSA Certified](https://www.psacertified.org/getting-certified/functional-api-certification/) to showcase compatible products.


## Example source code

Source code examples of both usage, and implementation, of the PSA Certified APIs are provided in the [examples/](/examples) folder.

## Related Projects

Known projects that implement or use the PSA Certified APIs are listed in [related-projects](/related-projects.md).

If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You under this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### About the license

The language in the additional patent license is largely identical to that in section 3 of [Apache License, Version 2.0][APACHE-2.0] (Apache 2.0) with two exceptions:

1. Changes are made related to the defined terms, to align those defined terms with the terminology in CC BY-SA 4.0 rather than Apache 2.0 (for example, changing "Work" to "Licensed Material").

2. The scope of the defensive termination clause is changed from "any patent licenses granted to You" to "any licenses granted to You". This change is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing additional protection to the community against patent litigation claims.
