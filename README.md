Subject to the terms and conditions of this license (both the CC BY-SA 4.0 Public License and this Patent License), each Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone or by combination of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material to which such contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You under this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

### About the license

The language in the additional patent license is largely identical to that in section 3 of [Apache License, Version 2.0][APACHE-2.0] (Apache 2.0) with two exceptions:

1. Changes are made related to the defined terms, to align those defined terms with the terminology in CC BY-SA 4.0 rather than Apache 2.0 (for example, changing "Work" to "Licensed Material").

2. The scope of the defensive termination clause is changed from "any patent licenses granted to You" to "any licenses granted to You". This change is intended to help maintain a healthy ecosystem by providing additional protection to the community against patent litigation claims.
