.. Glossary terms used in this specification

.. term:: Application Root of Trust
    :abbr: ARoT

    This is the security domain in which additional security services are implemented. See :cite-title:`PSM`.

.. scterm:: Implementation Defined

    Behavior that is not defined by the this specification, but is defined and documented by individual implementations.

    Firmware developers can choose to depend on :sc:`IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED` behavior, but must be aware that their code might not be portable to another implementation.

.. term:: Non-secure Processing Environment
    :abbr: NSPE

    This is the security domain outside of the :term:`Secure Processing Environment`. It is the Application domain, typically containing the application firmware and hardware.

.. term:: Platform Root of Trust
    :abbr: PRoT

    The overall trust anchor for the system. This ensures the platform is securely booted and configured, and establishes the secure environments required to protect security services. See :cite-title:`PSM`.

.. term:: Root of Trust
    :abbr: RoT

    This is the minimal set of software, hardware and data that is implicitly trusted in the platform --- there is no software or hardware at a deeper level that can verify that the Root of Trust is authentic and unmodified.

.. term:: Root of Trust Service
    :abbr: RoT Service

    A set of related security operations that are provided by a :term:`Root of Trust`.

.. term:: Secure Partition

    A processing context with protected runtime state within the :term:`Secure Processing Environment`. A secure partition may implement one or more :term:`RoT Service`\s, accessible via well-defined interfaces.

.. term:: Secure Processing Environment
    :abbr: SPE

    This is the security domain that includes the :term:`Platform Root of Trust` and the :term:`Application Root of Trust` domains.

.. term:: Secure Partition Manager
    :abbr: SPM

    Part of the :term:`Secure Processing Environment` that is responsible for allocating resources to :term:`Secure Partition`\s, managing the isolation and execution of software within partitions, and providing IPC between partitions.
