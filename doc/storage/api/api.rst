API Reference
=============

Status codes
------------

The |API| uses the status code definitions that are shared with the other PSA Certified APIs.

The following elements are defined in :file:`psa/error.h` from :cite-title:`PSA-STAT` (previously defined in :cite:`PSA-FF-M`):

.. code-block:: xref

   typedef int32_t psa_status_t;

   #define PSA_SUCCESS ((psa_status_t)0)

   #define PSA_ERROR_GENERIC_ERROR         ((psa_status_t)-132)
   #define PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED         ((psa_status_t)-133)
   #define PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED         ((psa_status_t)-134)
   #define PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT      ((psa_status_t)-135)
   #define PSA_ERROR_DOES_NOT_EXIST        ((psa_status_t)-140)
   #define PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE  ((psa_status_t)-142)
   #define PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE       ((psa_status_t)-146)
   #define PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE     ((psa_status_t)-149)
   #define PSA_ERROR_DATA_CORRUPT          ((psa_status_t)-152)

These definitions must be available to an application that includes either of the :file:`psa/internal_trusted_storage.h` or :file:`psa/protected_storage.h` header files.

.. admonition:: Implementation note

   An implementation is permitted to define the status code interface elements within the |API| header files, or to define them via inclusion of a :file:`psa/error.h` header file that is shared with the implementation of other PSA Certified APIs.

.. struct:: psa_storage_info_t

    .. summary::
        A container for metadata associated with a specific ``uid``.

    .. field:: size_t capacity
        The allocated capacity of the storage associated with a ``uid``.
    .. field:: size_t size
        The size of the data associated with a ``uid``.
    .. field:: psa_storage_create_flags_t flags
        The flags set when the ``uid`` was create

.. struct:: psa_its_storage_iterator_t

    .. summary::
        An implementation-defined opaque structure containing the context for an iterator.
        The structure MUST contain all all the state required by the iterator.
        That is, further state MUST NOT be retained by the implementation.

        The structure is initialized by the ``ps_iterator_start()`` function.
        It is modified by the ``ps_iterator_next()`` function.

        the caller can discard or reuse the iterator object once it has finished using it. This can be before, or after, the iterator has reached the end of the iteration.

        The header file is only required to define this structure if PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_ITERATION is true.

.. struct:: psa_ps_storage_iterator_t

    .. summary::
        An implementation-defined opaque structure containing the context for an iterator.
        The structure MUST contain all all the state required by the iterator.
        That is, further state MUST NOT be retained by the implementation.

        The structure is initilaised by the ``ps_iterator_start()`` function.
        It is modified by the ``ps_iterator_next()`` function.

        the caller can discard or reuse the iterator object once it has finished using it. This can be before, or after, the iterator has reached the end of the iteration.

        The header file is only required to define this structure if PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_ITERATION is true.

.. typedef:: uint32_t psa_storage_create_flags_t

    .. summary::
        Flags used when creating a data entry.


.. typedef:: uint64_t psa_storage_uid_t

    .. summary::
        A type for ``uid`` used for identifying data.


.. macro:: PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_NONE
    0u

    No flags to pass.

.. macro:: PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_WRITE_ONCE
    (1u << 0)

    The data associated with the ``uid`` will not be able to be modified or deleted. Intended to be used to set bits in `psa_storage_create_flags_t`.

.. macro:: PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_NO_CONFIDENTIALITY
    (1u << 1)

    The data associated with the ``uid`` is public and therefore does not require confidentiality. It therefore only needs to be integrity protected.

.. macro:: PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_NO_REPLAY_PROTECTION
    (1u << 2)

    The data associated with the ``uid`` does not require replay protection. This can permit faster storage --- but it permits an attacker with physical access to revert to an earlier version of the data.

.. macro:: PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_REPLACE
    (1u << 3)

    Flag instructing the `psa_ps_rename()` function to replace existing stored data.

.. macro:: PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_SET_EXTENDED

        The identifier for the data.
    .. param:: size_t data_length
        The size in bytes of the data in ``p_data``.
        If ``data_length == 0`` the implementation will create a zero-length asset associated with the ``uid``.
        While no data can be stored in such an asset, a call to `psa_its_get_info()` will return ``PSA_SUCCESS``.

        A buffer of ``data_length`` containing the data to store.
    .. param:: psa_storage_create_flags_t create_flags
        The flags that the data will be stored with.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
        A status indicating the success or failure of the operation.

    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        The operation completed successfully.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED
        The operation failed because the provided ``uid`` value was already created with `PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_WRITE_ONCE`.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
        The operation failed because one or more of the flags provided in ``create_flags`` is not supported or is not valid.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_STORAGE
        The operation failed because there was insufficient space on the storage medium.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
        The operation failed because the physical storage has failed (Fatal error).
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The operation failed because either:

        * the ``uid`` is ``0``.

        * caller cannot access some or all of the memory in the range [``p_data``, ``p_data + data_length - 1``].

    Stores data in the internal storage.

    * The ``uid`` value must not be zero.

    * If ``uid`` exists it must not have been created as with `PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_WRITE_ONCE` --- would result in ``PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED``.

    * The caller must have access all memory from ``p_data`` to ``p_data + data_length``.

    * Even if all parameters are correct, the function can fail if there is insufficient storage space or in the case of a storage failure.


.. function:: psa_its_get

    .. summary::
        Retrieve data associated with a provided ``uid``.

    .. param:: psa_storage_uid_t uid
        The ``uid`` value.
    .. param:: size_t data_offset
        The starting offset of the data requested.
    .. param:: size_t data_size
        The amount of data requested.
    .. param:: void * p_data
        On success, the buffer where the data will be placed.
    .. param:: size_t * p_data_length
        On success, this will contain size of the data placed in ``p_data``.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
        A status indicating the success or failure of the operation.

    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        The operation completed successfully.

        The operation failed because the provided ``uid`` value was not found in the storage.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
        The operation failed because the physical storage has failed (Fatal error).
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The operation failed because either:

        * The ``uid`` is ``0``.

        * The caller cannot access some or all of the memory in the range [``p_data``, ``p_data + data_size - 1``].

        * ``data_offset`` is larger than the size of the data associated with ``uid``.


    Retrieves data associated with ``uid``, starting at ``data_offset`` bytes from the beginning of the data. Fetches the lesser of ``data_size`` or ``uid.size - data_offset`` bytes, which can be zero.

    `psa_its_get()` must not return bytes from beyond the end of ``uid``.

    Upon successful completion, the data will be placed in the ``p_data`` buffer, which must be at least ``data_size`` bytes in size. The length of the data returned will be in ``p_data_length``. Any bytes beyond ``p_data_length`` are left unmodified.

    If ``data_size`` is ``0`` or ``data_offset == uid.size``, the contents of ``p_data_length`` will be set to zero, but the contents of ``p_data`` are unchanged. The function returns ``PSA_SUCCESS``.

    * The ``uid`` value must not be zero.

    * The value of ``data_offset`` must be less than or equal to the length of ``uid``.

    * If ``data_offset`` is greater than ``uid.size``, no data is retrieved and the functions returns PSA_INVALID_ARGUMENT.

    * If ``data_size`` is not zero, ``p_data`` must not be ``NULL``.

    * The call must have access to the memory from ``p_data`` to ``p_data + data_size - 1``.

    * If the location ``uid`` exists the lesser of ``data_size`` or ``uid.size - data_offset`` bytes are written to the output buffer and ``p_data_length`` is set to the number of bytes written, which can be zero.

    * Even if all parameters are correct, the function can fail in the case of a storage failure.

    .. summary::
        Retrieve the metadata about the provided ``uid``.

    .. param:: psa_storage_uid_t uid
        The ``uid`` value.
    .. param:: struct psa_storage_info_t * p_info
        A pointer to the `psa_storage_info_t` struct that will be populated with the metadata.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
        A status indicating the success or failure of the operation.

    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        The operation completed successfully.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DOES_NOT_EXIST
        The operation failed because the provided ``uid`` value was not found in the storage.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
        The operation failed because the physical storage has failed (Fatal error).
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The operation failed because either:

        * The ``uid`` is ``0``.

        * The caller cannot access some or all of the memory in the range [``p_info``, :code:`p_info + sizeof(psa_storage_info_t) - 1`]

    Retrieves the metadata stored for a given ``uid`` as a `psa_storage_info_t` structure.

    * The ``uid`` value must not be zero.

    * The call must have access to the memory from ``p_info`` to :code:`p_info + sizeof(psa_storage_info_t) - 1`.

    * If the location ``uid`` exists the metadata for the object is written to ``p_info``.

    * Even if all parameters are correct, the function can fail in the case of a storage failure.


.. function:: psa_its_remove

    .. summary::
        Remove the provided ``uid`` and its associated data from the storage.

    .. param:: psa_storage_uid_t uid
        The ``uid`` value.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
        A status indicating the success or failure of the operation.

    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        The operation completed successfully.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DOES_NOT_EXIST
        The operation failed because the provided ``uid`` value was not found in the storage.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The ``uid`` is ``0``.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED
        The operation failed because the provided ``uid`` value was created with `PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_WRITE_ONCE`.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
        The operation failed because the physical storage has failed (Fatal error).

    Deletes the data from internal storage.

    * The ``uid`` value must not be zero.

    * If ``uid`` exists it and any metadata are removed from storage.

    * Even if all parameters are correct, the function can fail in the case of a storage failure.

.. function:: psa_its_iterator_start

   .. summary::
       Initializes an iterator that can be used to return a list of ``uid`` values in the Internal Trusted Storage.
       
       This function must be fully defined if `PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_ITERATION` is true.
       
       If `PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_ITERATION` is false, then this function SHALL always return ``PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED``


   .. param::  psa_its_storage_iterator_t* context
       A pointer to a context for this iterator. The pointer may be NULL. This is set to a new value on success and is undefined on error. The content of the iterator is implementation defined.

   .. param:: psa_storage_uid_t filter
       A value used to filter the results included in this iteration.

   .. param:: int_t filter_length
       A length of the filter to use, this must be a value ``0 < filter_length < 63``.

   .. param:: psa_storage_uid_t *result
        A pointer to the location in which to store ``uid``. On success the contents of this location will be updated with the first matching ``uid``. On error, the contents are undefined.

   .. return:: psa_status_t
       A status indicating the success or failure of the operation.

   .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
       The operation completed successfully.

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DOES_NOT_EXIST
       No ``uid`` matches this iteration.

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
       The operation failed because the physical storage has failed (Fatal error).

   The iterator returns those values where the ``filter_length`` bits of the ``uid`` matches the left most bits in ``filter``.

   The iterator will only returns those ``uid`` that were created by the caller. It MUST not return any ``uid`` created by a different user.

   An iterator is not required to return uids in any specific order, but MUST return them in a consistent order each time it is called. For example, if an implementation returns entries in numerical order, it should not arbitrarily change to returning them in creation order. However, the caller should not make assumptions as to the order in which entries are returned, except that each ``uid`` will be returned only once in each iteration.

   Changes to storage by other users MUST NOT affect any open iterations.

   A caller may initialize multiple iteration contexts at the same time. Each iteration shall be independent. Calling ``psa_its_iterator_next()`` on one iterator MUST not effect any other open iteration.

   An iterator MUST return all data objects whose ``uid`` matches the filter that are extant when the filter was created, unless these are deleted or renamed before the iteration would return them, or the caller stops before all matching objects have been returned.

   A caller may delete a ``uid`` with `psa_its_remove()` without invalidating the iteration context. the iterator MUST never return a ``uid`` that has been deleted. However, if the caller is multi-threaded it is possible another thread may delete a ``uid``.

   A caller may read the contents of any ``uid`` with `psa_its_get()` or write with `psa_its_set` without invalidating the iteration context.

   A caller may create a ``uid`` with `psa_its_set()` without invalidating the iteration context. However, the iterator is NOT guaranteed to return the new object, ``uid``, the behavior is dependent on both implementation and identity. In particular, the iterator is not expected to return ``uid`` if the iteration is already past the point at which it would naturally be returned.

   A caller may call ``psa_its_rename(uid, uid_new)`` without invalidating the iteration context. The iterator must not return ``uid``. The iterator is not guaranteed to return ``uid_new``, the behavior is dependent on both implementation and identity.

   The following code snippet uses a linked list to store the matching files before iterating over that list and removing them.

   .. code-block:: c

      my_context = NULL;
      my_filter = 0x1111 0000 0000 0000;
      my_length = 0x0020;
      my_result = NULL;
      if psa_its_iterator_start(my_context, my_filter, my-length, my_result) == PSA_SUCCESS
      	{
      	do
      	   {
      	   	// do something with my_result
      	    psa_its_iterator_next(my_context, my_result)
      	    // we will get an does not exist error when we reach the last item, any other error is a storage failure
      	    if my_reult <> PSA_ERROR_DOES_NOT_EXIST
      	   	  {
      	   	  	/* deal with storage failure */
      	   	  }
      	   }
        while my_result == PSA_SUCCESS ;
        };




.. function:: psa_its_iterator_next

      Returns the next ``uid`` in this iteration.
      This function must be fully defined if `PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_ITERATION` is true.
      If `PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_ITERATION` is false, then this function SHALL always return ``PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED``


   .. param::  psa_its_storage_iterator_t* context
       A pointer to a context for this iterator as returned by `psa_its_iterator_start()` or updated by a previous call to `psa_its_iterator_next()`.  The content of the iterator will change on success and is undefined on error.

   .. param:: psa_storage_uid_t *result

   .. return:: psa_status_t
       A status indicating the success or failure of the operation.

   .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS

       The iterator has returned all the uids that match this iteration.

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
       The operation failed because the physical storage has failed (Fatal error).

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_CORRUPT
       The operation failed because the contents of the iteration have changed. That is a ``uid`` matching the filter has either been created or deleted.

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
       The operation failed because either:

       * The provided context is not valid.

       * The caller cannot access the memory at ``result``

.. function:: psa_its_get_support

        * The caller cannot access some or all of the memory in the range [``p_data``, ``p_data + data_size - 1``].

        * ``data_offset`` is larger than the size of the data associated with ``uid``.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DOES_NOT_EXIST
        The operation failed because the provided ``uid`` value was not found in the storage.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
        The operation failed because the physical storage has failed (Fatal error).
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_GENERIC_ERROR
        The operation failed because of an unspecified internal failure.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_CORRUPT
        The operation failed because the data associated with the ``uid`` has been corrupted.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE
        The operation failed because the data associated with the ``uid`` failed authentication.

    Retrieves data associated with ``uid``, starting at ``data_offset`` bytes from the beginning of the data. Fetches the smaller of   ``data_size`` or ``uid.size - data_offset`` bytes.  This can be zero.

    `psa_ps_get()` must not return bytes from beyond the end of ``uid``.

    Upon successful completion, the data will be placed in the ``p_data`` buffer, which must be at least ``data_size`` bytes in size. The length of the data returned will be in ``p_data_length``. Any bytes beyond ``p_data_length`` are left unmodified.

    If ``data_size`` is ``0`` or ``data_offset == uid.size``, the contents of ``p_data_length`` will be set to zero, but the contents of ``p_data`` are unchanged. The function returns ``PSA_SUCCESS``.

    * The ``uid`` value must not be zero.

    * The value of ``data_offset`` must be less than or equal to the length of ``uid``.

    * If ``data_offset`` is greater than ``uid.size`` the function retrieves no data and returns ``PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT``

    * If ``data_size`` is not zero, ``p_data`` must not be ``NULL``.

    * The call must have access to the memory from ``p_data`` to ``p_data + data_size - 1``.

    * If the location ``uid`` exists the lesser of ``data_size`` and ``uid.size - data_offset`` bytes are written to the output buffer and ``p_data_length`` is set to the number of bytes written, which can be zero.

    * Any bytes in the buffer beyond ``p_data_length`` are left unmodified.

    * Even if all parameters are correct, the function can fail in the case of a storage failure.

    Retrieves the metadata stored for a given ``uid`` as a `psa_storage_info_t` structure.

    * The ``uid`` value must not be zero.

    * The call must have access to the memory from ``p_info`` to :code:`p_info + sizeof(psa_storage_info_t) - 1`.

    * If the location ``uid`` exists the metadata for the object is written to ``p_info``.

    * Even if all parameters are correct, the function can fail in the case of a storage failure.

        Storage for the specified ``uid`` already exists.

    Reserves storage for the specified ``uid``. Upon success, the capacity of the storage is ``capacity``, and the size is ``0``.

    It is only necessary to call this function for assets that will be written with the `psa_ps_set_extended()` function. If only the `psa_ps_set()` function is needed, calls to this function are redundant.

    This function cannot be used to replace or resize an existing asset and attempting to do so will return ``PSA_ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS``.

    If the `PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_WRITE_ONCE` flag is passed, `psa_ps_create()` will return ``PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED``.

    This function is optional. Consult the platform documentation to determine if it is implemented or perform a call to `psa_ps_get_support()`. This function must be implemented if `psa_ps_get_support()` returns `PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_SET_EXTENDED`.

    * The ``uid`` value must not be zero.

    * If ``uid`` must not exist.

    * The flag `PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_WRITE_ONCE` must not be set.

    * Even if all parameters are correct, the function can fail if there is insufficient storage space or in the case of a storage failure.



.. function:: psa_ps_set_extended

    .. summary::
        Overwrite part of the data of the specified ``uid``, leaving remaining data unchanged.
        This function must be fully defined if `PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_SET_EXTENDED` is true.
        If `PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_SET_EXTENDED` is false, then this function SHALL always return ``PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED``.

    .. param:: psa_storage_uid_t uid
        The unique identifier for the asset.
    .. param:: size_t data_offset
        Offset within the asset to start the write.
    .. param:: size_t data_length
        The size in bytes of the data in ``p_data`` to write.
    .. param:: const void * p_data
        Pointer to a buffer which contains the data to write.

    .. return:: psa_status_t

    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        The asset exists, the input parameters are correct and the data is correctly written in the physical storage.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The operation failed because either:

        * The ``uid`` is ``0``.

        * The caller cannot access some or all of the memory in the range [``p_data``, ``p_data + data_size - 1``].

        * One or more of the preconditions regarding ``data_offset``, ``size``, or ``data_length`` was violated.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DOES_NOT_EXIST
        The specified ``uid`` was not found.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
        The implementation does not support this function.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
        The operation failed because the physical storage has failed (Fatal error).
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_GENERIC_ERROR
        The operation failed due to an unspecified error.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_CORRUPT
        The operation failed because the existing data has been corrupted.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE
        The operation failed because the existing data failed authentication (MAC check failed).
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED
        The operation failed because it was attempted on an asset which was written with the flag `PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_WRITE_ONCE`.

    Sets partial data into an asset based on the given identifier, ``data_offset``, ``data length`` and ``p_data``.

    Before calling this function, the storage must have been reserved with a call to `psa_ps_create()`. It can also be used to overwrite data in an asset that was created with a call to `psa_ps_set()`.

    Calling this function with ``data_length == 0`` is permitted. This makes no change to the stored data.

    This function can overwrite existing data and/or extend it up to the capacity for the ``uid`` specified in ``psa_ps_create()`` but cannot create gaps.

      This function is optional. Consult the platform documentation to determine if it is implemented or perform a call to ``psa_ps_get_support()``. This function must be implemented if ``psa_ps_get_support()`` returns ``PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_SET_EXTENDED``.

    * The ``uid`` value must not be zero.

    * If ``uid`` exists it must not have been created as with ``PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_WRITE_ONCE`` - would result in ``PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED``

    * ``data_offset <= size``

    * ``data_offset + data_length <= capacity``

    * Even if all parameters are correct, the function can fail in the case of a storage failure.

    On Success:

    * ``size = max(size, data_offset + data_length)``

    * ``capacity`` unchanged.

    * Data in the ranges 0 to ``data_offset`` is not modified.

    * If ``data_offset + data_length < size`` then data in the range ``data_offset + data_length` to `size`` is not modified.



.. function:: psa_ps_rename

   .. summary::
      Atomically renames the storage location with the specified ``uid`` to a ``uid_new``.
      This function must be fully defined if `PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_RENAME` is true.
      If `PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_RENAME` is false, then this function SHALL always return ``PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED``.

   .. param:: psa_storage_uid_t uid
        The current identifier for the data.

   .. param:: psa_storage_uid_t uid_new
        The new identifier for the data.

   .. param:: psa_storage_rename_flags_t rename_flags
        The flags must be either ``PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_NONE`` or ``PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_REPLACE``

   .. return:: psa_status_t
        A status indicating the success or failure of the operation.

   .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        The operation completed successfully.

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS
        Storage with the specified ``uid_new`` already exists and ``rename_flags`` is `PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_NONE`

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DOES_NOT_EXIST
        Storage with the specified ``uid`` does not exist.

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_GENERIC_ERROR
        The operation failed because of an unspecified internal failure.

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The operation failed because either:

        * ``uid`` is ``0``.
        * ``uid_new`` is ``0``
        * the ``psa_storage_rename_flags_t`` has a value set other than `PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_REPLACE`

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED
        The operation failed because ``uid_new`` exists and was created with `PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_WRITE_ONCE`.

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
        The implementation does not support the operation.

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
        The operation failed because the physical storage has failed (Fatal error).


   The function renames ``uid`` to ``uid_new`` retaining the storage flags  that ``uid`` was created with.

   If the caller specifies `PSA_STORAGE_FLAG_REPLACE` the operation atomically replaces the existing contents of ```uid_new`` with those of ``uid``.

   Except in the case of ``PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE``, in which case no guarantees can be made, the operation shall either succeed or leave storage unchanged.


.. function:: psa_ps_iterator_start

   .. summary::
       Initializes an iterator that can be used to return a list of uids in the Protected Storage.
       This function must be fully defined if `PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_ITERATION` is true.
       If `PSA_STORAGE_SUPPORT_ITERATION` is false, then this function SHALL always return ``PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED``


   .. param::  psa_ps_storage_iterator_t* context
       A pointer to a context for this iterator. The pointer may be NULL. This is set to a new value on success and is undefined on error. The content of the iterator is implementation defined.

   .. param:: psa_storage_uid_t filter
       A value used to filter the results included in this iteration.

   .. param:: int_t filter_length
       A length of the filter to use, this must be a value ``0 < filter_length < 63``.

   .. param:: psa_storage_uid_t *result
        A pointer to the location in which to store ``uid``. On success the contents of this location will be updated with the first matching ``uid``. On error, the contents are undefined.

   .. return:: psa_status_t
       A status indicating the success or failure of the operation.

   .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
       The operation completed successfully.

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DOES_NOT_EXIST
       No ``uid`` matches this iteration.

   .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
       The operation failed because the physical storage has failed (Fatal error).

   The iterator returns those values where the ``filter_length`` bits of the ``uid`` matches the left most bits in ``filter``.

   The iterator will only returns those ``uid`` that were created by the caller. It MUST not return any ``uid`` created by a different user.

   An iterator is not required to return uids in any specific order, but MUST return them in a consistent order each time it is called. For example, if an implementation returns entries in numerical order, it should not arbitrarily change to returning them in creation order. However, the caller should not make assumptions as to the order in which entries are returned, except that each ``uid`` will be returned only once in each iteration.

   Changes to storage by other users MUST NOT affect any open iterations.

   A caller may initialize multiple iteration contexts at the same time. Each iteration shall be independent. Calling ``psa_ps_iterator_next`` on one iterator MUST not effect any other open iteration.

   An iterator MUST return all data objects whose ``uid`` matches the filter that are extant when the filter was created, unless these are deleted or renamed before the iteration would return them, or the caller stops before all matching objects have been returned.

   A caller may delete a ``uid`` with `psa_ps_remove()` without invalidating the iteration context. the iterator MUST never return a ``uid`` that has been deleted. However, if the caller is multi-threaded it is possible another thread may delete a ``uid``.

   A caller may read the contents of any ``uid`` with `psa_ps_get()` or write with `psa_ps_set()` or `psa_ps_set_extended()` without invalidating the iteration context.

   A caller may create a ``uid`` with `psa_ps_set()` or `psa_ps_create()` without invalidating the iteration context. However, the iterator is NOT guaranteed to return the new object, ``uid``, the behavior is dependent on both implementation and identity. In particular, the iterator is not expected to return ``uid`` if the iteration is already past the point at which it would naturally be returned.

   A caller may call ``psa_ps_rename(uid, uid_new)`` without invalidating the iteration context. The iterator must not return ``uid``. The iterator is not guaranteed to return ``uid_new``, the behavior is dependent on both implementation and identity.

   The following code snippet uses a linked list to store the matching files before iterating over that list and removing them.

   .. code-block:: c

      my_context = NULL;
      my_filter = 0x1111 0000 0000 0000;
      my_length = 0x0020;
      my_result = NULL;
      if psa_ps_iterator_start(my_context, my_filter, my-length, my_result) == PSA_SUCCESS
      	{
      	do
      	   {
      	   	// do something with my_result
      	    psa_ps_iterator_next(my_context, my_result)
      	    // we will get an 'does not exist error' when we reach the last item, any other error is a storage failure
      	    if my_reult <> PSA_ERROR_DOES_NOT_EXIST
      	   	  {
      	   	  	/* deal with storage failure */
      	   	  }
      	   }
        while my_result == PSA_SUCCESS ;
        };
