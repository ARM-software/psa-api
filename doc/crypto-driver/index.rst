    .. abstract::

        This document describes an interface for cryptoprocessor drivers within an implementation of the PSA Certified Crypto API.
        This interface complements :cite-title:`PSA-CRYPT`, which describes the interface between a Crypto API implementation and an application.

    .. banner:: **DRAFT**

        This specification is work in progress and should be considered to be in at 'alpha' quality.

        At this stage, the following changes are expected:

        * Completing missing parts of the interface.
        * Alignment with the published Crypto API for PAKE.
        * Improvements based on the experience of early implementations.
