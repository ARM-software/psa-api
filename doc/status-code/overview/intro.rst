About Platform Security Architecture
------------------------------------

This document is one of a set of resources provided by Arm that can help organizations develop products that meet the security requirements of GlobalPlatform's PSA Certified evaluation scheme on Arm-based platforms. The PSA Certified scheme provides a framework and methodology that helps silicon manufacturers, system software providers and OEMs to develop more secure products. Arm resources that support PSA Certified range from threat models, standard architectures that simplify development and increase portability, and open-source partnerships that provide ready-to-use software. You can read more about PSA Certified here at :url:`www.psacertified.org` and find more Arm resources here at :url:`developer.arm.com/platform-security-resources` and :url:`www.trustedfirmware.org`.
