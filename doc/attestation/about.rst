.. Terms used within this specification

.. term:: Initial Attestation Key
    :abbr: IAK

    Typically, the Initial Attestation Key is a secret private key from an asymmetric key-pair accessible only to the Initial Attestation service within the :term:`Platform Root of Trust`. See :cite-title:`PSM`.

.. term:: PSA

    Platform Security Architecture

.. term:: Platform Root of Trust
    :abbr: PRoT

    The overall trust anchor for the system. This ensures the platform is securely booted and configured, and establishes the secure environments required to protect security services. See :cite-title:`PSM`.

.. scterm:: Implementation Defined

    Behavior that is not defined by this specification, but is defined and documented by individual implementations.

    Application developers can choose to depend on :sc:`IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED` behavior, but must be aware that their code might not be portable to another implementation.

.. term:: Secure Processing Environment
    :abbr: SPE

    This is the security domain that includes the :term:`Platform Root of Trust` domain.

.. term:: Non-secure Processing Environment
    :abbr: NSPE

    This is the security domain outside of the :term:`Secure Processing Environment`. It is the application domain, typically containing the application firmware and hardware.
