        * First stable release
        * The API functions now use the shared ``psa_status_t`` return type.
        * Error values now use shared error codes, which are now defined in :file:`psa/error.h`.
        * Input parameters are now separate from output parameters. There are no longer any in/out parameters.
        * Size types have been replaced with ``size_t`` instead of ``uint32_t``.
        * Some parameter names have been changed to improve legibility.
        * The description of the Implementation ID claim has been rewritten to better match the definition in PSM.
        * Signer ID is no longer a mandatory part of the Software Components claim. However, it is needed for PSM compliance.
        * Explicitly describe which optional claims are required for PSM compliance.
        * Added lifecycle state (``PSA_LIFECYCLE_ASSEMBLY_AND_TEST``).
        * Clarifications and improvements to the description of some API elements and to the structure of the document.
        * Updated CBOR example in the appendix.

        * Fixed typos and descriptions based on feedback.

    * - 2020-02-06
      - *1.0 Release 2 (1.0.2)*

        * Fix CBOR type of ``arm_psa_origination`` to text string. Spec and example were in conflict, and the example was correct.
        * Added CDDL definition to the appendices, which can be helpful to developers.
        * Instance ID definition for symmetric keys has been improved. The specific constructions are now recommended rather than normative.
        * Clarified the optionality of map entries in the Software Components claim. See :secref:`custom-claims`.
