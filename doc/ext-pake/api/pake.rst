.. macro:: PSA_ALG_IS_PAKE
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether the specified algorithm is a password-authenticated key exchange.

    .. param:: alg
        An algorithm identifier: a value of type :code:`psa_algorithm_t`.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` is a password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) algorithm, ``0`` otherwise.
        This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported algorithm identifier.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_JPAKE
    :definition: ((psa_algorithm_t)0x0a000100)

    .. summary::
        The Password-authenticated key exchange by juggling (J-PAKE) algorithm.

    This is J-PAKE as defined by :RFC-title:`8236`, instantiated with the following parameters:

    *   The group can be either an elliptic curve or defined over a finite field.
    *   Schnorr NIZK proof as defined by :RFC-title:`8235`, using the same group as the J-PAKE algorithm.
    *   A cryptographic hash function.

    To select these parameters and set up the cipher suite, initialize a `psa_pake_cipher_suite_t` object, and call the following functions in any order:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite = PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT;

        psa_pake_cs_set_algorithm(cipher_suite, PSA_ALG_JPAKE);
        psa_pake_cs_set_primitive(cipher_suite,
                                  PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE(type, family, bits));
        psa_pake_cs_set_hash(cipher_suite, hash);

    More information on selecting a specific Elliptic curve or Diffie-Hellman field is provided with the `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC` and `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_DH` constants.

    The J-PAKE operation follows the protocol shown in :numref:`fig-jpake`.

    .. figure:: /figure/j-pake.*
        :name: fig-jpake

        The J-PAKE protocol.

        The variable names *x1*, *g1*, and so on, are taken from the finite field implementation of J-PAKE in :RFC:`8236#2`. Details of the computation for the key shares and zero-knowledge proofs are in :RFC:`8236` and :RFC:`8235`.

    J-PAKE does not assign roles to the participants, so it is not necessary to call `psa_pake_set_role()`.

    J-PAKE requires both an application and a peer identity. If the peer identity provided to `psa_pake_set_peer()` does not match the data received from the peer, then the call to `psa_pake_input()` for the `PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF` step will fail with :code:`PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE`.

    The following steps demonstrate the application code for 'User' in :numref:`fig-jpake`.
    The input and output steps must be carried out in exactly the same sequence as shown.

    1.  To prepare a J-Pake operation, initialize and set up a :code:`psa_pake_operation_t` object by calling the following functions:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_operation_t jpake = PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT;

            psa_pake_setup(&jpake, &cipher_suite);
            psa_pake_set_user(&jpake, ...);
            psa_pake_set_peer(&jpake, ...);
            psa_pake_set_password_key(&jpake, ...);

        The password is provided as a key.
        This can be the password text itself, in an agreed character encoding, or some value derived from the password as required by a higher level protocol.

        The key material is used as an array of bytes, which is converted to an integer as described in :cite-title:`SEC1` ยง2.3.8, before reducing it modulo *q*.
        Here, *q* is the order of the group defined by the cipher-suite primitive.
        `psa_pake_set_password_key()` will return an error if the result of the conversion and reduction is ``0``.

    After setup, the key exchange flow for J-PAKE is as follows:

    1.  To get the first round data that needs to be sent to the peer, call:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Get g1
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Get V1, the ZKP public key for x1
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Get r1, the ZKP proof for x1
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);
            // Get g2
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Get V2, the ZKP public key for x2
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Get r2, the ZKP proof for x2
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

    #.  To provide the first round data received from the peer to the operation, call:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Set g3
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Set V3, the ZKP public key for x3
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Set r3, the ZKP proof for x3
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);
            // Set g4
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Set V4, the ZKP public key for x4
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Set r4, the ZKP proof for x4
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

    #.  To get the second round data that needs to be sent to the peer, call:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Get A
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Get V5, the ZKP public key for x2*s
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Get r5, the ZKP proof for x2*s
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

    #.  To provide the second round data received from the peer to the operation call:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Set B
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Set V6, the ZKP public key for x4*s
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Set r6, the ZKP proof for x4*s
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

    #.  To use the shared secret, set up a key derivation operation and transfer the computed value:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Set up the KDF
            psa_key_derivation_operation_t kdf = PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_OPERATION_INIT;
            psa_key_derivation_setup(&kdf, ...);
            psa_key_derivation_input_bytes(&kdf, PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_INPUT_CONTEXT, ...);
            psa_key_derivation_input_bytes(&kdf, PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_INPUT_LABEL, ...);

            // Get Ka=Kb=K
            psa_pake_get_implicit_key(&jpake, &kdf)

    For more information about the format of the values which are passed for each step, see :secref:`pake-steps`.

    If the verification of a Zero-knowledge proof provided by the peer fails, then the corresponding call to `psa_pake_input()` for the `PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF` step will return :code:`PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE`.

    .. warning::

        At the end of this sequence there is a cryptographic guarantee that only a peer that used the same password is able to compute the same key.
        But there is no guarantee that the peer is the participant it claims to be, or that the peer used the same password during the exchange.

        At this point, authentication is implicit --- material encrypted or authenticated using the computed key can only be decrypted or verified by someone with the same key.
        The peer is not authenticated at this point, and no action should be taken by the application which assumes that the peer is authenticated, for example, by accessing restricted files.

        To make the authentication explicit, there are various methods to confirm that both parties have the same key. See :RFC:`8236#5` for two examples.

.. _pake-primitive:

PAKE primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A PAKE algorithm specifies a sequence of interactions between the participants.
Many PAKE algorithms are designed to allow different cryptographic primitives to be used for the key establishment operation, so long as all the participants are using the same underlying cryptography.

The cryptographic primitive for a PAKE operation is specified using a `psa_pake_primitive_t` value, which can be constructed using the `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()` macro, or can be provided as a numerical constant value.

A PAKE primitive is required when constructing a PAKE cipher-suite object, `psa_pake_cipher_suite_t`, which fully specifies the PAKE operation to be carried out.


.. typedef:: uint8_t psa_pake_primitive_type_t

    .. summary::
        Encoding of the type of the PAKE's primitive.

    The range of PAKE primitive type values is divided as follows:

    :code:`0x00`
        Reserved as an invalid primitive type.
    :code:`0x01 โ 0x7f`
        Specification-defined primitive type.
        Primitive types defined by this standard always have bit 7 clear.
        Unallocated primitive type values in this range are reserved for future use.
    :code:`0x80 โ 0xff`
        Implementation-defined primitive type.
        Implementations that define additional primitive types must use an encoding with bit 7 set.

    For specification-defined primitive types, see the documentation of individual ``PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_XXX`` constants.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC
    :definition: ((psa_pake_primitive_type_t)0x01)

    .. summary::
        The PAKE primitive type indicating the use of elliptic curves.

    The values of the ``family`` and ``bits`` components of the PAKE primitive identify a specific elliptic curve, using the same mapping that is used for ECC keys.
    See the definition of ``psa_ecc_family_t``.
    Here ``family`` and ``bits`` refer to the values used to construct the PAKE primitive using `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

    Input and output during the operation can involve group elements and scalar values:

    *   The format for group elements is the same as that for public keys on the specific Elliptic curve.
        For more information, consult the documentation of key formats in `[PSA-CRYPT]`.
    *   The format for scalars is the same as that for private keys on the specific Elliptic curve.
        For more information, consult the documentation of key formats in `[PSA-CRYPT]`.


.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_DH
    :definition: ((psa_pake_primitive_type_t)0x02)

    .. summary::
        The PAKE primitive type indicating the use of Diffie-Hellman groups.

    The values of the ``family`` and ``bits`` components of the PAKE primitive identify a specific Diffie-Hellman group, using the same mapping that is used for Diffie-Hellman keys.
    See the definition of ``psa_dh_family_t``.
    Here ``family`` and ``bits`` refer to the values used to construct the PAKE primitive using `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

    Input and output during the operation can involve group elements and scalar values:

    *   The format for group elements is the same as that for public keys in the specific Diffie-Hellman group.
        For more information, consult the documentation of key formats in `[PSA-CRYPT]`.
    *   The format for scalars is the same as that for private keys in the specific Diffie-Hellman group.
        For more information, consult the documentation of key formats in `[PSA-CRYPT]`.


.. typedef:: uint8_t psa_pake_family_t

    .. summary::
        Encoding of the family of the primitive associated with the PAKE.

    For more information see the documentation of individual ``PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_XXX`` constants.

.. typedef:: uint32_t psa_pake_primitive_t

    .. summary::
        Encoding of the primitive associated with the PAKE.

    PAKE primitive values are constructed using `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

    .. rationale::

        An integral type is required for `psa_pake_primitive_t` to enable values of this type to be compile-time-constants. This allows them to be used in ``case`` statements, and used to calculate static buffer sizes with `PSA_PAKE_OUTPUT_SIZE()` and `PSA_PAKE_INPUT_SIZE()`.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Construct a PAKE primitive from type, family and bit-size.

    .. param:: pake_type
        The type of the primitive: a value of type `psa_pake_primitive_type_t`.
    .. param:: pake_family
        The family of the primitive.
        The type and interpretation of this parameter depends on ``pake_type``.
        For more information, consult the documentation of individual `psa_pake_primitive_type_t` constants.
    .. param:: pake_bits
        The bit-size of the primitive: a value of type ``size_t``.
        The interpretation of this parameter depends on ``family``.
        For more information, consult the documentation of individual `psa_pake_primitive_type_t` constants.

    .. return:: psa_pake_primitive_t
        The constructed primitive value.
        Return ``0`` if the requested primitive can't be encoded as `psa_pake_primitive_t`.


.. _pake-cipher-suite:

PAKE cipher suites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A PAKE algorithm uses a specific cryptographic primitive for key establishment, specified using a `PAKE primitive <pake-primitive>`. PAKE algorithms also require a cryptographic hash algorithm, which is agreed between the participants.

The `psa_pake_cipher_suite_t` object is used to fully specify a PAKE operation, combining the PAKE algorithm, the PAKE primitive, the hash or any other algorithm that parametrises the PAKE in question.

A PAKE cipher suite is required when setting up a PAKE operation in `psa_pake_setup()`.


.. typedef:: /* implementation-defined type */ psa_pake_cipher_suite_t

    .. summary::
        The type of an object describing a PAKE cipher suite.

    This is the object that represents the cipher suite used for a PAKE algorithm. The PAKE cipher suite specifies the PAKE algorithm, and the options selected for that algorithm. The cipher suite includes the following attributes:

    *   The PAKE algorithm itself.
    *   The PAKE primitive, which identifies the prime order group used for the key exchange operation. See :secref:`pake-primitive`.
    *   The hash algorithm to use in the operation.

    .. note::
        Implementations are recommended to define the cipher-suite object as a simple data structure, with fields corresponding to the individual cipher suite attributes. In such an implementation, each function ``psa_pake_cs_set_xxx()`` sets a field and the corresponding function ``psa_pake_cs_get_xxx()`` retrieves the value of the field.

        An implementations can report attribute values that are equivalent to the original one, but have a different encoding. For example, an implementation can use a more compact representation for attributes where many bit-patterns are invalid or not supported, and store all values that it does not support as a special marker value. In such an implementation, after setting an invalid value, the corresponding get function returns an invalid value which might not be the one that was originally stored.

    This is an implementation-defined type. Applications that make assumptions about the content of this object will result in implementation-specific behavior, and are non-portable.

    Before calling any function on a PAKE cipher suite object, the application must initialize it by any of the following means:

    *   Set the object to all-bits-zero, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite;
            memset(&cipher_suite, 0, sizeof(cipher_suite));

    *   Initialize the object to logical zero values by declaring the object as static or global without an explicit initializer, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            static psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite;

    *   Initialize the object to the initializer `PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT`, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite = PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT;

    *   Assign the result of the function `psa_pake_cipher_suite_init()` to the object, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite;
            cipher_suite = psa_pake_cipher_suite_init();

    ..  Do we need anything like the following?

        .. rubric:: Usage

        A typical sequence to create a key is as follows:

        1.  Create and initialize an attribute object.
        #.  If the key is persistent, call `psa_set_key_id()`. Also call `psa_set_key_lifetime()` to place the key in a non-default location.
        #.  Set the key policy with `psa_set_key_usage_flags()` and `psa_set_key_algorithm()`.
        #.  Set the key type with `psa_set_key_type()`. Skip this step if copying an existing key with `psa_copy_key()`.
        #.  When generating a random key with `psa_generate_key()` or deriving a key with `psa_key_derivation_output_key()`, set the desired key size with `psa_set_key_bits()`.
        #.  Call a key creation function: `psa_import_key()`, `psa_generate_key()`, `psa_key_derivation_output_key()` or `psa_copy_key()`. This function reads the attribute object, creates a key with these attributes, and outputs an identifier for the newly created key.
        #.  Optionally call `psa_reset_key_attributes()`, now that the attribute object is no longer needed. Currently this call is not required as the attributes defined in this specification do not require additional resources beyond the object itself.

        A typical sequence to query a key's attributes is as follows:

        1.  Call `psa_get_key_attributes()`.
        #.  Call ``psa_get_key_xxx()`` functions to retrieve the required attribute(s).
        #.  Call `psa_reset_key_attributes()` to free any resources that can be used by the attribute object.

        If this is :code:`PSA_ALG_NONE`, the hash algorithm in ``cipher_suite`` becomes unspecified.

    .. return:: void

    This function overwrites any hash algorithm previously set in ``cipher_suite``.

    The documentation of individual PAKE algorithms specifies which hash algorithms are compatible, or if no hash algorithm is required.

    .. admonition:: Implementation note

        This is a simple accessor function that is not required to validate its inputs. It can be efficiently implemented as a ``static inline`` function or a function-like macro.


.. _pake-roles:

PAKE roles
~~~~~~~~~~

Some PAKE algorithms need to know which role each participant is taking in the algorithm. For example:

*   Augmented PAKE algorithms typically have a client and a server participant.
*   Some symmetric PAKE algorithms need to assign an order to the participants.

.. typedef:: uint8_t psa_pake_role_t

    .. summary::
        Encoding of the application role in a PAKE algorithm.

    This type is used to encode the application's role in the algorithm being executed.
    For more information see the documentation of individual PAKE role constants.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_ROLE_NONE
    :definition: ((psa_pake_role_t)0x00)

    .. summary::
        A value to indicate no role in a PAKE algorithm.

    This value can be used in a call to `psa_pake_set_role()` for symmetric PAKE algorithms which do not assign roles.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_ROLE_FIRST
    :definition: ((psa_pake_role_t)0x01)

    .. summary::
        The first peer in a balanced PAKE.

    Although balanced PAKE algorithms are symmetric, some of them need the peers to be ordered for the transcript calculations.
    If the algorithm does not need a specific ordering, then either do not call `psa_pake_set_role()`, or use `PSA_PAKE_ROLE_NONE` as the role parameter.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_ROLE_SECOND
    :definition: ((psa_pake_role_t)0x02)

    .. summary::
        The second peer in a balanced PAKE.

    Although balanced PAKE algorithms are symmetric, some of them need the peers to be ordered for the transcript calculations.
    If the algorithm does not need a specific ordering, then either do not call `psa_pake_set_role()`, or use `PSA_PAKE_ROLE_NONE` as the role parameter.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_ROLE_CLIENT
    :definition: ((psa_pake_role_t)0x11)

    .. summary::
        The client in an augmented PAKE.

    Augmented PAKE algorithms need to differentiate between client and server.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_ROLE_SERVER
    :definition: ((psa_pake_role_t)0x12)

    .. summary::
        The server in an augmented PAKE.

    Augmented PAKE algorithms need to differentiate between client and server.


.. _pake-steps:

PAKE step types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. typedef:: uint8_t psa_pake_step_t

    .. summary::
        Encoding of input and output steps for a PAKE algorithm.

    Some PAKE algorithms need to exchange more data than a single key share.
    This type encodes additional input and output steps for such algorithms.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE
    :definition: ((psa_pake_step_t)0x01)

    .. summary::
        The key share being sent to or received from the peer.

    The format for both input and output using this step is the same as the format for public keys on the group specified by the PAKE operation's primitive.

    The public key formats are defined in the documentation for :code:`psa_export_public_key()`.

    For information regarding how the group is determined, consult the documentation `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC
    :definition: ((psa_pake_step_t)0x02)

    .. summary::
        A Schnorr NIZKP public key.

    This is the ephemeral public key in the Schnorr Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof, this is the value denoted by *V* in :RFC:`8235`.

    The format for both input and output at this step is the same as that for public keys on the group specified by the PAKE operation's primitive.

    For more information on the format, consult the documentation of :code:`psa_export_public_key()`.

    For information regarding how the group is determined, consult the documentation `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF
    :definition: ((psa_pake_step_t)0x03)

    .. summary::
        A Schnorr NIZKP proof.

    This is the proof in the Schnorr Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof, this is the value denoted by *r* in :RFC:`8235`.

    Both for input and output, the value at this step is an integer less than the order of the group specified by the PAKE operation's primitive.
    The format depends on the group as well:

    *   For Montgomery curves, the encoding is little endian.
    *   For other Elliptic curves, and for Diffie-Hellman groups, the encoding is big endian. See :cite:`SEC1` ยง2.3.8.

    In both cases leading zeroes are permitted as long as the length in bytes does not exceed the byte length of the group order.

    For information regarding how the group is determined, consult the documentation `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM
    :definition: ((psa_pake_step_t)0x04)

    .. summary::
        The key confirmation value.

    This value is used during the key confirmation phase of a PAKE protocol. The format of the value depends on the algorithm and cipher suite:

    *   For :code:`PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P`, the format for both input and output at this step is the same as the output of the MAC algorithm specified in the cipher suite.

.. _pake-operation:

Multi-part PAKE operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. typedef:: /* implementation-defined type */ psa_pake_operation_t

    .. summary::
        The type of the state object for PAKE operations.

    Before calling any function on a PAKE operation object, the application must initialize it by any of the following means:

    *   Set the object to all-bits-zero, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_operation_t operation;
            memset(&operation, 0, sizeof(operation));

    *   Initialize the object to logical zero values by declaring the object as static or global without an explicit initializer, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            static psa_pake_operation_t operation;

    *   Initialize the object to the initializer `PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT`, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_operation_t operation = PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT;

    *   Assign the result of the function `psa_pake_cipher_suite_init()` to the object, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_operation_t operation;
            operation = psa_pake_operation_init();

    This is an implementation-defined type. Applications that make assumptions about the content of this object will result in implementation-specific behavior, and are non-portable.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT
    :definition: /* implementation-defined value */

    .. summary::
        This macro returns a suitable initializer for a PAKE operation object of type `psa_pake_operation_t`.

.. function:: psa_pake_operation_init

    .. summary::
        Return an initial value for a PAKE operation object.

    .. return:: psa_pake_operation_t

.. function:: psa_pake_setup

    .. summary::
        Set the session information for a password-authenticated key exchange.

    .. param:: psa_pake_operation_t *operation
        The operation object to set up.
        It must have been initialized as per the documentation for `psa_pake_operation_t` and not yet in use.
    .. param:: const psa_pake_cipher_suite_t *cipher_suite
        The cipher suite to use.
        A PAKE cipher suite fully characterizes a PAKE algorithm, including the PAKE algorithm.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success. The operation is now active.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The operation state is not valid: it must be inactive.
        *   The library requires initializing by a call to :code:`psa_crypto_init()`.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The algorithm in ``cipher_suite`` is not a PAKE algorithm.
        *   The PAKE primitive in ``cipher_suite`` is not compatible with the PAKE algorithm.
        *   The hash algorithm in ``cipher_suite`` is invalid, or not compatible with the PAKE algorithm and primitive.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The algorithm in ``cipher_suite`` is not a supported PAKE algorithm.
        *   The PAKE primitive in ``cipher_suite`` is not supported or not compatible with the PAKE algorithm.
        *   The hash algorithm in ``cipher_suite`` is not supported, or not compatible with the PAKE algorithm and primitive.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED

    The sequence of operations to set up a password-authenticated key exchange operation is as follows:

    1.  Allocate a PAKE operation object which will be passed to all the functions listed here.
    #.  Initialize the operation object with one of the methods described in the documentation for `psa_pake_operation_t`.
        For example, using `PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT`.
    #.  Call `psa_pake_setup()` to specify the cipher suite.
    #.  Call ``psa_pake_set_xxx()`` functions on the operation to complete the setup.
        The exact sequence of ``psa_pake_set_xxx()`` functions that needs to be called depends on the algorithm in use.

    A typical sequence of calls to perform a password-authenticated key exchange:

    1.  Call :code:`psa_pake_output(operation, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...)` to get the key share that needs to be sent to the peer.
    #.  Call :code:`psa_pake_input(operation, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...)` to provide the key share that was received from the peer.
    #.  Depending on the algorithm additional calls to `psa_pake_output()` and `psa_pake_input()` might be necessary.
    #.  Call `psa_pake_get_implicit_key()` to access the shared secret.

    Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for details on the required set up and operation for each algorithm.
    See :secref:`pake-algorithms`.

    After a successful call to `psa_pake_setup()`, the operation is active, and the application must eventually terminate the operation. The following events terminate an operation:

    *   A successful call to `psa_pake_get_implicit_key()`.
    *   A call to `psa_pake_abort()`.

    If `psa_pake_setup()` returns an error, the operation object is unchanged. If a subsequent function call with an active operation returns an error, the operation enters an error state.

    To abandon an active operation, or reset an operation in an error state, call `psa_pake_abort()`.

    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_CORRUPT
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_INVALID

    At this step in the PAKE operation there is a cryptographic guarantee that only an authenticated participant who used the same password is able to compute the key.
    But there is no guarantee that the peer is the participant it claims to be, and was able to compute the same key.

    In this situation, the authentication is only implicit.
    Since the peer is not authenticated, no action should be taken that assumes that the peer is who it claims to be
    For example, do not access restricted files on the peer's behalf until an explicit authentication has succeeded.

    This function can be called after the key exchange phase of the operation has completed.
    It injects the shared secret output of the PAKE into the provided key derivation operation.
    The input step :code:`PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_INPUT_SECRET` is used to input the shared key material into the key derivation operation.

    The exact sequence of calls to perform a password-authenticated key exchange depends on the algorithm in use.
    Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for more information.
    See :secref:`pake-algorithms`.

    When this function returns successfully, ``operation`` becomes inactive.
    If this function returns an error status, both the ``operation`` and the ``key_derivation`` operations enter an error state and must be aborted by calling `psa_pake_abort()` and :code:`psa_key_derivation_abort()` respectively.

.. function:: psa_pake_abort

    .. summary::
        Abort a PAKE operation.

    .. param:: psa_pake_operation_t * operation
        Initialized PAKE operation.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success.
        The operation object can now be discarded or reused.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The library requires initializing by a call to :code:`psa_crypto_init()`.

    Aborting an operation frees all associated resources except for the ``operation`` object itself.
    Once aborted, the operation object can be reused for another operation by calling `psa_pake_setup()` again.

    This function can be called any time after the operation object has been initialized as described in `psa_pake_operation_t`.

    In particular, calling `psa_pake_abort()` after the operation has been terminated by a call to `psa_pake_abort()` or `psa_pake_get_implicit_key()` is safe and has no effect.


Support macros

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_OUTPUT_SIZE
    :definition: /* implementation-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Sufficient output buffer size for `psa_pake_output()`, in bytes.

    .. param:: alg
        A PAKE algorithm: a value of type :code:`psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_PAKE(alg)` is true.
    .. param:: primitive
        A primitive of type `psa_pake_primitive_t` that is compatible with algorithm ``alg``.
    .. param:: output_step
        A value of type `psa_pake_step_t` that is valid for the algorithm ``alg``.

    .. return::
        A sufficient output buffer size for the specified PAKE algorithm, primitive, and output step.
        An implementation can return either ``0`` or a correct size for a PAKE algorithm, primitive, and output step that it recognizes, but does not support.
        If the parameters are not valid, the return value is unspecified.

    If the size of the output buffer is at least this large, it is guaranteed that `psa_pake_output()` will not fail due to an insufficient buffer size.
    The actual size of the output might be smaller in any given call.

    .. param:: alg
        A PAKE algorithm: a value of type :code:`psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_PAKE(alg)` is true.
    .. param:: primitive
        A primitive of type `psa_pake_primitive_t` that is compatible with algorithm ``alg``.
    .. param:: input_step
        A value of type `psa_pake_step_t` that is valid for the algorithm ``alg``.

    .. return::
        A sufficient buffer size for the specified PAKE algorithm, primitive, and input step.
        An implementation can return either ``0`` or a correct size for a PAKE algorithm, primitive, and output step that it recognizes, but does not support.
        If the parameters are not valid, the return value is unspecified.

    The value returned by this macro is guaranteed to be large enough for any valid input to `psa_pake_input()` in an operation with the specified parameters.

    This macro can be useful when transferring inputs from the peer into the PAKE operation.
