Password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE)
==========================================

This is a proposed PAKE interface for :cite-title:`PSA-CRYPT`.
It is not part of the official |API| yet.

.. note::

    The content of this specification is not part of the stable |API| and may change substantially from version to version.

Algorithm encoding
------------------

A new algorithm category is added for PAKE algorithms. The algorithm category table in `[PSA-CRYPT]` Appendix B is extended with the information in :numref:`table-pake-algorithm-category`.

a.  ``hh`` is the HASH-TYPE for the hash algorithm, ``hash``, used to construct the key derivation algorithm.

Key encoding
------------

A new type of asymmetric key is added for the SPAKE2+ algorithms. The Asymmetric key sub-type values table in `[PSA-CRYPT]` Appendix B is extended with the information in :numref:`table-spake2p-keys`.

.. csv-table:: New SPAKE2+ asymmetric key sub-type

    SPAKE2+, 4, See :secref:`spakep2-key-encoding`

.. rationale::

    The ASYM-TYPE value 4 is selected as this has the same parity as the ECC sub-type, which have the value 1. The enables the same ECC-FAMILY and P values to be used when encoding a SPAKE2+ key type, as is used in the Elliptic Curve key types.

    Twisted Edwards, 0x21, 0, :code:`PSA_ECC_FAMILY_TWISTED_EDWARDS`, ``0x4442``, ``0x7442``

a.  The key type value is constructed from the Elliptic Curve family using either :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_PUBLIC_KEY(family)` or :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_KEY_PAIR(family)` as required.

Key formats
-----------

A SPAKE2+ public key can be exported and imported, to enable use cases that require offline registration.

The public key consists of the two values w0 and L, which result from the SPAKE2+ registration phase. w0 is a scalar in the same range as a private Elliptic curve key from the group used as the SPAKE2+ primitive group. L is a point on the curve, similar to a public key from the same group.

The default format for the SPAKE2+ public key is the concatenation of the formatted values for w0 and L, using the the standard formats for Elliptic curve keys. For example, for SPAKE2+ over P-256 (secp256r1), the output from :code:`psa_export_public_key()` would be:

    [ w0 ]\ :sub:`32` || 0x04 || [ x\ :sub:`L` ]\ :sub:`32` || [ y\ :sub:`L` ]\ :sub:`32`

Where [ v ]\ :sub:`n` is an n-byte, big-endian encoding of the integer value v.

.. todo::
    In this example, how does using a 'concatenation of elements' depiction compare to the 'bullet list of elements' approach used in the Weierstrass public key format in ยง9.6.4?

.. todo::
    In this example, how does the short-hand notation --- [ v ]\ :sub:`n` --- compare with the text description approach used in the Weierstrass public key format in ยง9.6.4, or the function-based (e.g. ``I2OSP()``) approach used in texts such as SEC1?

.. todo::
    Would it be better to provide an explicit definition for all of the elliptic curves over which SPAKE2+ is defined, rather than just provide a single example?

.. todo::
    It might also be time to decide on how to style/format pseudo-mathematical content of the specification. Presently there is a arbitrary mixture of ``monospace code/LaTeX-source-style material a^b = 1, F_q`` (as typical in IETF RFCs) and *emphasized* or regular font .rst material a\ :sup:`b` = 1, *F*\ :sub:`q` (seen in NIST publications, and some IETF RFCs). But we also have the ability to use the ``:math:`` role to :math:`\text{render like LaTeX: } a^b=1, \mathbb{F}_q` (used in SECG and some NIST publications).

SPAKE2+ keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SPAKE2+ protocol consists of three phases:

1.  Registration
2.  Authenticated key exchange
3.  Key confirmation

The registration phase can be carried out immediately prior to the other phases, or can be carried out offline, and the result of the registration phase transferred to the participants in the protocol for later online authentication.

The |API| uses an asymmetric key-pair, and public-key, to store the output of the registration, for input to the authentication protocol. The registration is carried out using a key derivation operation, and the key exchange and confirmation is carried out using a PAKE operation. For a SPAKE2+ PAKE operation, the prover, or client, role requires a SPAKE2+ key-pair, while the verifier, or server, role can use either a SPAKE2+ key-pair or SPAKE2+ public key.

The SPAKE2+ algorithms are based on Elliptic curve groups, and a SPAKE2+ key is parameterized by a specific Elliptic curve. The Elliptic curve families are used to parameterize the key type, and the key size selects the specific curve. :issue:`Is this overkill? - RFC9383 only specifies cipher-suites that use the SECP R1 curves and the Edwards curves, we could have a custom set of families`

        The elliptic curve family id, if ``type`` is a supported SPAKE2+ key. Unspecified if ``type`` is not a supported SPAKE2+ key.

Key derivation of SPAKE2+ keys
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The SPAKE2+ key types can be output from a key derivation using :code:`psa_key_derivation_output_key()`. The SPAKE2+ protocol recommends that a key-stretching kdf, such as PBKDF2, is used to hash the SPAKE2+ password. See RFC 9383 for details.

For example, after setting up the PBKDF2 operation, the following process will derive the SPAKE2+ key pair for use with the P-256 Elliptic curve group :issue:`(This example may be more than necessary in the specification?)`:

1.  Allocate and initialize a key attributes object:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_key_attributes_t att = PSA_KEY_ATTRIBUTES_INIT;

#.  Set the key type and size:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_set_key_type(&att, PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_KEY_PAIR(PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_R1));
        psa_set_key_bits(&att, 256);            // for P-256

#.  Set the key policy:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_set_key_usage_flags(&att, PSA_KEY_USAGE_????);
        psa_set_key_algorithm(&att, PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P);

    :issue:`Do we need a new usage flag for augmented PAKEs? For example PSA_KEY_USAGE_PROVE/VERIFY. Or do we just use PSA_KEY_USAGE_DERIVE as specified by psa_pake_set_password_key()?`

#.  Derive the key:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_key_id_t sp2_key;
        psa_key_derivation_output_key(&att, &kdf_op, &sp2_key);

The key derivation process in :code:`psa_key_derivation_output_key()` follows the recommendations for the registration process in RFC 9383, and matches the specification of this process in the Matter specification.

For the |API|:

*   The derivation of SPAKE2+ keys extracts ceil(log2(p)/8) + 8 bytes from the PBKDF for each of w0s and w1s, where p is the prime factor of the order of the elliptic curve group.
*   The calculation of w0, w1, and L then proceeds as described in the RFC.
*   A SPAKE2+ key-pair is the pair (w0, w1).
*   A SPAKE2+ public key is the pair (w0, L).

.. todo::
    Would a table of required w0s/w1s lengths for each of the supported SPAKE2+ elliptic curve groups be useful here?

PAKE algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_IS_PAKE
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether the specified algorithm is a password-authenticated key exchange.

    .. param:: alg
        An algorithm identifier: a value of type :code:`psa_algorithm_t`.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` is a password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) algorithm, ``0`` otherwise.
        This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported algorithm identifier.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_JPAKE
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Macro to build the Password-authenticated key exchange by juggling (J-PAKE) algorithm.

    .. param:: hash_alg
        A hash algorithm: a value of type :code:`psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_HASH(hash_alg)` is true.

    .. return::
        A J-PAKE algorithm, parameterized by a specific hash.

        Unspecified if ``hash_alg`` is not a supported hash algorithm.


    This is J-PAKE as defined by :RFC-title:`8236`, instantiated with the following parameters:

    *   The group can be either an elliptic curve or defined over a finite field.
    *   Schnorr Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof (NIZKP) as defined by :RFC-title:`8235`, using the same group as the J-PAKE algorithm.
    *   A cryptographic hash function, ``hash_alg``.

    J-PAKE does not confirm the shared secret key that results from the key exchange.

    To select these parameters and set up the cipher suite, initialize a `psa_pake_cipher_suite_t` object, and call the following functions in any order:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite = PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT;

        psa_pake_cs_set_algorithm(&cipher_suite, PSA_ALG_JPAKE(hash));
        psa_pake_cs_set_primitive(&cipher_suite,
                                  PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE(type, family, bits));
        psa_pake_cs_set_key_confirmation(&cipher_suite, PSA_PAKE_UNCONFIRMED_KEY);

    More information on selecting a specific Elliptic curve or Diffie-Hellman field is provided with the `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC` and `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_DH` constants.

    The J-PAKE operation follows the protocol shown in :numref:`fig-jpake`.

    .. figure:: /figure/j-pake.*
        :name: fig-jpake

        The J-PAKE protocol.

        The variable names *x1*, *g1*, and so on, are taken from the finite field implementation of J-PAKE in :RFC:`8236#2`. Details of the computation for the key shares and zero-knowledge proofs are in :RFC:`8236` and :RFC:`8235`.

    J-PAKE does not assign roles to the participants, so it is not necessary to call `psa_pake_set_role()`.

    J-PAKE requires both an application and a peer identity.
    If the peer identity provided to `psa_pake_set_peer()` does not match the data received from the peer, then the call to `psa_pake_input()` for the `PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF` step will fail with :code:`PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE`.

    The shared secret that is produced by J-PAKE is not suitable for use as an encryption key.
    It must be used as an input to a key derivation operation to produce additional cryptographic keys.

    The following steps demonstrate the application code for 'User' in :numref:`fig-jpake`.
    The input and output steps must be carried out in exactly the same sequence as shown.

    1.  To prepare a J-Pake operation, initialize and set up a :code:`psa_pake_operation_t` object by calling the following functions:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_operation_t jpake = PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT;

            psa_pake_setup(&jpake, pake_key, &cipher_suite);
            psa_pake_set_user(&jpake, ...);
            psa_pake_set_peer(&jpake, ...);

        The password is provided as key ``pake_key``, with type :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_PASSWORD` or :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_PASSWORD_HASH`.
        This can be the password text itself, in an agreed character encoding, or some value derived from the password as required by a higher level protocol.

        The key material is used as an array of bytes, which is converted to an integer as described in :cite-title:`SEC1` ยง2.3.8, before reducing it modulo *q*.
        Here, *q* is the order of the group defined by the cipher-suite primitive.
        `psa_pake_setup()` will return an error if the result of the conversion and reduction is ``0``.

    After setup, the key exchange flow for J-PAKE is as follows:

    1.  To get the first round data that needs to be sent to the peer, call:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Get g1
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Get V1, the ZKP public key for x1
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Get r1, the ZKP proof for x1
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);
            // Get g2
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Get V2, the ZKP public key for x2
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Get r2, the ZKP proof for x2
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

    #.  To provide the first round data received from the peer to the operation, call:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Set g3
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Set V3, the ZKP public key for x3
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Set r3, the ZKP proof for x3
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);
            // Set g4
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Set V4, the ZKP public key for x4
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Set r4, the ZKP proof for x4
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

    #.  To get the second round data that needs to be sent to the peer, call:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Get A
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Get V5, the ZKP public key for x2*s
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Get r5, the ZKP proof for x2*s
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

    #.  To provide the second round data received from the peer to the operation call:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Set B
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Set V6, the ZKP public key for x4*s
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Set r6, the ZKP proof for x4*s
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

    #.  To use the shared secret, extract it as a key-derivation key. For example, to extract a derivation key for HKDF-SHA-256:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Set up the key attributes
            psa_key_attributes_t att = PSA_KEY_ATTRIBUTES_INIT;
            psa_key_set_type(&att, PSA_KEY_TYPE_DERIVE);
            psa_key_set_usage_flags(&att, PSA_KEY_USAGE_DERIVE);
            psa_key_set_algorithm(&att, PSA_ALG_HKDF(PSA_ALG_SHA256));

            // Get Ka=Kb=K
            psa_key_id_t shared_key;
            psa_pake_get_shared_key(&jpake, &att, &shared_key);

    For more information about the format of the values which are passed for each step, see :secref:`pake-steps`.

    If the verification of a Zero-knowledge proof provided by the peer fails, then the corresponding call to `psa_pake_input()` for the `PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF` step will return :code:`PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE`.

    .. warning::

        At the end of this sequence there is a cryptographic guarantee that only a peer that used the same password is able to compute the same key.
        But there is no guarantee that the peer is the participant it claims to be, or that the peer used the same password during the exchange.

        At this point, authentication is implicit --- material encrypted or authenticated using the computed key can only be decrypted or verified by someone with the same key.
        The peer is not authenticated at this point, and no action should be taken by the application which assumes that the peer is authenticated, for example, by accessing restricted files.

        To make the authentication explicit, there are various methods to confirm that both parties have the same key. See :RFC:`8236#5` for two examples.

PAKE primitives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A PAKE algorithm specifies a sequence of interactions between the participants.
Many PAKE algorithms are designed to allow different cryptographic primitives to be used for the key establishment operation, so long as all the participants are using the same underlying cryptography.

The cryptographic primitive for a PAKE operation is specified using a `psa_pake_primitive_t` value, which can be constructed using the `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()` macro, or can be provided as a numerical constant value.

A PAKE primitive is required when constructing a PAKE cipher-suite object, `psa_pake_cipher_suite_t`, which fully specifies the PAKE operation to be carried out.


.. typedef:: uint8_t psa_pake_primitive_type_t

    .. summary::
        Encoding of the type of the PAKE's primitive.

    The range of PAKE primitive type values is divided as follows:

    :code:`0x00`
        Reserved as an invalid primitive type.
    :code:`0x01 โ 0x7f`
        Specification-defined primitive type.
        Primitive types defined by this standard always have bit 7 clear.
        Unallocated primitive type values in this range are reserved for future use.
    :code:`0x80 โ 0xff`
        Implementation-defined primitive type.
        Implementations that define additional primitive types must use an encoding with bit 7 set.

    For specification-defined primitive types, see the documentation of individual ``PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_XXX`` constants.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC
    :definition: ((psa_pake_primitive_type_t)0x01)

    .. summary::
        The PAKE primitive type indicating the use of elliptic curves.

    The values of the ``family`` and ``bits`` components of the PAKE primitive identify a specific elliptic curve, using the same mapping that is used for ECC keys.
    See the definition of ``psa_ecc_family_t``.
    Here ``family`` and ``bits`` refer to the values used to construct the PAKE primitive using `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

    Input and output during the operation can involve group elements and scalar values:

    *   The format for group elements is the same as that for public keys on the specific Elliptic curve.
        For more information, consult the documentation of key formats in `[PSA-CRYPT]`.
    *   The format for scalars is the same as that for private keys on the specific Elliptic curve.
        For more information, consult the documentation of key formats in `[PSA-CRYPT]`.

    The values of the ``family`` and ``bits`` components of the PAKE primitive identify a specific Diffie-Hellman group, using the same mapping that is used for Diffie-Hellman keys.
    See the definition of ``psa_dh_family_t``.
    Here ``family`` and ``bits`` refer to the values used to construct the PAKE primitive using `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

    Input and output during the operation can involve group elements and scalar values:

    *   The format for group elements is the same as that for public keys in the specific Diffie-Hellman group.
        For more information, consult the documentation of key formats in `[PSA-CRYPT]`.
    *   The format for scalars is the same as that for private keys in the specific Diffie-Hellman group.
        For more information, consult the documentation of key formats in `[PSA-CRYPT]`.

.. _pake-cipher-suite:

PAKE cipher suites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most PAKE algorithms have parameters that must be specified by the application. These parameters include the following:

*   The cryptographic primitive used for key establishment, specified using a `PAKE primitive <pake-primitive>`.
*   A cryptographic hash algorithm.
*   Whether the application requires the shared secret before, or after, it is confirmed.

The hash algorithm is encoded into the PAKE algorithm identifier. The `psa_pake_cipher_suite_t` object is used to fully specify a PAKE operation, combining the PAKE protocol with all of the above parameters.

A PAKE cipher suite is required when setting up a PAKE operation in `psa_pake_setup()`.


.. typedef:: /* implementation-defined type */ psa_pake_cipher_suite_t

    .. summary::
        The type of an object describing a PAKE cipher suite.

    This is the object that represents the cipher suite used for a PAKE algorithm. The PAKE cipher suite specifies the PAKE algorithm, and the options selected for that algorithm. The cipher suite includes the following attributes:

    *   The PAKE algorithm itself.
    *   The hash algorithm, encoded within the PAKE algorithm.
    *   The PAKE primitive, which identifies the prime order group used for the key exchange operation. See :secref:`pake-primitive`.
    *   Whether to confirm the shared secret.

    This is an implementation-defined type. Applications that make assumptions about the content of this object will result in implementation-specific behavior, and are non-portable.

    Before calling any function on a PAKE cipher suite object, the application must initialize it by any of the following means:

    *   Set the object to all-bits-zero, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite;
            memset(&cipher_suite, 0, sizeof(cipher_suite));

    *   Initialize the object to logical zero values by declaring the object as static or global without an explicit initializer, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            static psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite;

    *   Initialize the object to the initializer `PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT`, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite = PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT;

    *   Assign the result of the function `psa_pake_cipher_suite_init()` to the object, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite;
            cipher_suite = psa_pake_cipher_suite_init();

    Following initialization, the cipher-suite object contains the following values:

    .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 1 4
        :align: left

        *   -   Attribute
            -   Value

        *   -   algorithm
            -   :code:`PSA_ALG_NONE` --- an invalid algorithm identifier.
        *   -   primitive
            -   ``0`` --- an invalid PAKE primitive.
        *   -   key confirmation
            -   `PSA_PAKE_CONFIRMED_KEY` --- requesting that the secret key is confirmed before it can be returned.

    Valid algorithm, primitive, and key confirmation values must be set when using a PAKE cipher suite.

    .. admonition:: Implementation note

        Implementations are recommended to define the cipher-suite object as a simple data structure, with fields corresponding to the individual cipher suite attributes.
        In such an implementation, each function ``psa_pake_cs_set_xxx()`` sets a field and the corresponding function ``psa_pake_cs_get_xxx()`` retrieves the value of the field.

        An implementations can report attribute values that are equivalent to the original one, but have a different encoding.
        For example, an implementation can use a more compact representation for attributes where many bit-patterns are invalid or not supported, and store all values that it does not support as a special marker value.
        In such an implementation, after setting an invalid value, the corresponding get function returns an invalid value which might not be the one that was originally stored.

.. _pake-roles:

PAKE roles
~~~~~~~~~~

Some PAKE algorithms need to know which role each participant is taking in the algorithm. For example:

*   Augmented PAKE algorithms typically have a client and a server participant.
*   Some symmetric PAKE algorithms need to assign an order to the participants.

.. typedef:: uint8_t psa_pake_role_t

    .. summary::
        Encoding of the application role in a PAKE algorithm.

    This type is used to encode the application's role in the algorithm being executed.
    For more information see the documentation of individual PAKE role constants.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_ROLE_NONE
    :definition: ((psa_pake_role_t)0x00)

    .. summary::
        A value to indicate no role in a PAKE algorithm.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_ROLE_FIRST
    :definition: ((psa_pake_role_t)0x01)

    .. summary::
        The first peer in a balanced PAKE.

    Although balanced PAKE algorithms are symmetric, some of them need the peers to be ordered for the transcript calculations.
    If the algorithm does not need a specific ordering, then either do not call `psa_pake_set_role()`, or use `PSA_PAKE_ROLE_NONE` as the role parameter.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_ROLE_SECOND
    :definition: ((psa_pake_role_t)0x02)

    .. summary::
        The second peer in a balanced PAKE.

    Although balanced PAKE algorithms are symmetric, some of them need the peers to be ordered for the transcript calculations.

PAKE step types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. typedef:: uint8_t psa_pake_step_t

    .. summary::

        The key share being sent to or received from the peer.

    The format for both input and output using this step is the same as the format for public keys on the group specified by the PAKE operation's primitive.

    The public key formats are defined in the documentation for :code:`psa_export_public_key()`.

    For information regarding how the group is determined, consult the documentation `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC

    This is the ephemeral public key in the Schnorr Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof, this is the value denoted by *V* in :RFC:`8235`.

    The format for both input and output at this step is the same as that for public keys on the group specified by the PAKE operation's primitive.

    For more information on the format, consult the documentation of :code:`psa_export_public_key()`.

    For information regarding how the group is determined, consult the documentation `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF
    :definition: ((psa_pake_step_t)0x03)

    .. summary::
        A Schnorr NIZKP proof.

    This is the proof in the Schnorr Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof, this is the value denoted by *r* in :RFC:`8235`.

    Both for input and output, the value at this step is an integer less than the order of the group specified by the PAKE operation's primitive.
    The format depends on the group as well:

    *   For Montgomery curves, the encoding is little endian.
    *   For other Elliptic curves, and for Diffie-Hellman groups, the encoding is big endian. See :cite:`SEC1` ยง2.3.8.

    In both cases leading zeroes are permitted as long as the length in bytes does not exceed the byte length of the group order.

    For information regarding how the group is determined, consult the documentation `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM
    :definition: ((psa_pake_step_t)0x04)

    .. summary::
        The key confirmation value.

    This value is used during the key confirmation phase of a PAKE protocol. The format of the value depends on the algorithm and cipher suite:

    *   For :code:`PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P`, the format for both input and output at this step is the same as the output of the MAC algorithm specified in the cipher suite.

    The sequence of operations to set up a password-authenticated key exchange operation is as follows:

    1.  Allocate a PAKE operation object which will be passed to all the functions listed here.
    #.  Initialize the operation object with one of the methods described in the documentation for `psa_pake_operation_t`.
        For example, using `PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT`.
    #.  Call `psa_pake_setup()` to specify the cipher suite.
    #.  Call ``psa_pake_set_xxx()`` functions on the operation to complete the setup.
        The exact sequence of ``psa_pake_set_xxx()`` functions that needs to be called depends on the algorithm in use.

    A typical sequence of calls to perform a password-authenticated key exchange:

    1.  Call :code:`psa_pake_output(operation, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...)` to get the key share that needs to be sent to the peer.
    #.  Call :code:`psa_pake_input(operation, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...)` to provide the key share that was received from the peer.
    #.  Depending on the algorithm additional calls to `psa_pake_output()` and `psa_pake_input()` might be necessary.
    #.  Call `psa_pake_get_shared_key()` to access the shared secret.

    Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for details on the required set up and operation for each algorithm, and for constraints on the format and content of valid passwords.
    See :secref:`pake-algorithms`.

    After a successful call to `psa_pake_setup()`, the operation is active, and the application must eventually terminate the operation. The following events terminate an operation:

    *   A successful call to `psa_pake_get_shared_key()`.
    *   A call to `psa_pake_abort()`.

    If `psa_pake_setup()` returns an error, the operation object is unchanged. If a subsequent function call with an active operation returns an error, the operation enters an error state.

    To abandon an active operation, or reset an operation in an error state, call `psa_pake_abort()`.

.. function:: psa_pake_get_shared_key

    .. summary::
        Extract the shared secret from the PAKE as a key.

    .. param:: psa_pake_operation_t *operation
        Active PAKE operation.
    .. param:: const psa_key_attributes_t * attributes
        The attributes for the new key.
        This function uses the attributes as follows:

        *   The key type is required.
            All PAKE algorithms can output a key of type :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_DERIVE` or :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_HMAC`.
            PAKE algorithms that produce a pseudo-random shared secret, can also output block-cipher key types, for example :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_AES`.
            Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for more information.
            See :secref:`pake-algorithms`.
        *   The key size in ``attributes`` must be zero.
            The returned key size is always determined from the PAKE shared secret.
        *   The key permitted-algorithm policy is required for keys that will be used for a cryptographic operation.

            .. see :secref:`permitted-algorithms`.

        *   The key usage flags define what operations are permitted with the key.

            .. see :secref:`key-usage-flags`.

        *   The key lifetime and identifier are required for a persistent key.

        .. note::
            This is an input parameter: it is not updated with the final key attributes.
            The final attributes of the new key can be queried by calling :code:`psa_get_key_attributes()` with the key's identifier.
    .. param:: psa_key_id_t * key
        On success, an identifier for the newly created key. :code:`PSA_KEY_ID_NULL` on failure.


    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success.
        If the key is persistent, the key material and the key's metadata have been saved to persistent storage.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The state of PAKE operation ``operation`` is not valid: it must be ready to return the shared secret.

            For an unconfirmed key, this will be when the key-exchange output and input steps are complete, but prior to any key-confirmation output and input steps.

            For a confirmed key, this will be when all key-exchange and key-confirmation output and input steps are complete.
        *   The library requires initializing by a call to :code:`psa_crypto_init()`.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS
        This is an attempt to create a persistent key, and there is already a persistent key with the given identifier.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
        The key attributes, as a whole, are not supported for creation from a PAKE secret, either by the implementation in general or in the specified storage location.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The key type is not valid for output from this operation's algorithm.
        *   The key size is nonzero.
        *   The key lifetime is invalid.
        *   The key identifier is not valid for the key lifetime.
        *   The key usage flags include invalid values.
        *   The key's permitted-usage algorithm is invalid.
        *   The key attributes, as a whole, are invalid.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED
        The implementation does not permit creating a key with the specified attributes due to some implementation-specific policy.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_CORRUPT
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_INVALID

    This is the final call in a PAKE operation, which retrieves the shared secret as a key.
    It is recommended that this key is used as an input to a key derivation operation to produce additional cryptographic keys.
    For some PAKE algorithms, the shared secret is also suitable for use as a key in cryptographic operations such as encryption.
    Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for more information, see :secref:`pake-algorithms`.

    Depending on the key confirmation requested in the cipher suite, `psa_pake_get_shared_key()` must be called either before or after the key-confirmation output and input steps for the PAKE algorithm.
    The key confirmation affects the guarantees that can be made about the shared key:

    .. list-table::
        :class: borderless
        :widths: 1 4

        *   -   **Unconfirmed key**
            -   If the cipher suite used to set up the operation requested an unconfirmed key, the application must call `psa_pake_get_shared_key()` after the key-exchange output and input steps are completed.
                The PAKE algorithm provides a cryptographic guarantee that only a peer who used the same password, and identity inputs, is able to compute the same key.
                However, there is no guarantee that the peer is the participant it claims to be, and was able to compute the same key.

                Since the peer is not authenticated, no action should be taken that assumes that the peer is who it claims to be.
                For example, do not access restricted files on the peer's behalf until an explicit authentication has succeeded.

                .. note::
                    Some PAKE algorithms do not enable the output of the shared secret until it has been confirmed.

        *   -   **Confirmed key**
            -   If the cipher suite used to set up the operation requested a confirmed key, the application must call `psa_pake_get_shared_key()` after the key-exchange and key-confirmation output and input steps are completed.

                Following key confirmation, the PAKE algorithm provides a cryptographic guarantee that the peer used the same password and identity inputs, and has computed the identical shared secret key.

                Since the peer is not authenticated, no action should be taken that assumes that the peer is who it claims to be.
                For example, do not access restricted files on the peer's behalf until an explicit authentication has succeeded.

                .. note::
                    Some PAKE algorithms do not include any key-confirmation steps.

    The exact sequence of calls to perform a password-authenticated key exchange depends on the algorithm in use.
    Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for more information.
    See :secref:`pake-algorithms`.

    When this function returns successfully, ``operation`` becomes inactive.
    If this function returns an error status, the operation enters an error state and must be aborted by calling `psa_pake_abort()`.

.. function:: psa_pake_abort

    .. summary::
        Abort a PAKE operation.

    .. param:: psa_pake_operation_t * operation
        Initialized PAKE operation.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success.
        The operation object can now be discarded or reused.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The library requires initializing by a call to :code:`psa_crypto_init()`.

    Aborting an operation frees all associated resources except for the ``operation`` object itself.
    Once aborted, the operation object can be reused for another operation by calling `psa_pake_setup()` again.

    This function can be called any time after the operation object has been initialized as described in `psa_pake_operation_t`.

    In particular, calling `psa_pake_abort()` after the operation has been terminated by a call to `psa_pake_abort()` or `psa_pake_get_shared_key()` is safe and has no effect.
