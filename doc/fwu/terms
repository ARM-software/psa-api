.. scterm:: Implementation Defined

   Behavior that is not defined by the this specification, but is defined and documented by individual implementations.

   Firmware developers can choose to depend on :sc:`IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED` behavior, but must be aware that their code might not be portable to another implementation.

.. term:: PSA

   Platform Security Architecture

.. term:: Root of Trust
   :abbr: RoT

   This is the minimal set of software, hardware and data that is implicitly trusted in the platform --- there is no software or hardware at a deeper level that can verify that the Root of Trust is authentic and unmodified.

.. term:: Platform Root of Trust
   :abbr: PRoT

   The overall trust anchor for the system. This ensures the platform is securely booted and configured, and establishes the secure environments required to protect security services. See :cite-title:`PSM`.

.. term:: Immutable Platform Root of Trust

   Part of the :term:`Platform Root of Trust`, which is inherently trusted. This refers to the hardware and firmware that cannot be updated on a production device. See :cite-title:`PSM`.

.. term:: Updatable Platform Root of Trust

   Part of the :term:`Platform Root of Trust` firmware that can be updated following manufacturing. See :cite-title:`PSM`.

.. term:: Application Root of Trust

   This is the security domain in which additional security services are implemented. See :cite-title:`PSM`.

.. term:: Secure Processing Environment
   :abbr: SPE

   This is the security domain that includes the :term:`Platform Root of Trust` and the :term:`Application Root of Trust` domains.

.. term:: Non-secure Processing Environment
   :abbr: NSPE

   This is the security domain outside of the :term:`Secure Processing Environment`. It is the Application domain, typically containing the :term:`application firmware` and hardware.

.. term:: Application firmware

   The main application firmware for the platform, typically comprising an Operating System (OS) and application tasks.  On a platform with isolation, the application firmware runs in the :term:`NSPE`.

.. term:: Update client

   Software component that is responsible for downloading firmware updates to the device. The Update client is part of the :term:`application firmware`.

.. term:: MPU

   Memory protection unit

.. term:: Over-the-Air
   :abbr: OTA

   The procedure where a device downloads an update from a remote location ("over the air").

.. term:: Secure boot

   Secure boot is technology to provide a chain of trust for all the components during boot.

.. term:: OEM

   Original equipment manufacturer

.. term:: PKI

   Public key infrastructure

.. term:: Manifest

   Firmware image metadata that is signed with a cryptographic key. The manifest can be bundled within the firmware image, or detached from it.

   See :secref:`manifest`.

.. term:: Volatile staging

   A component with volatile staging does not preserve a firmware image that is in the :term:`staging area` after a reboot.

   A component without volatile staging preserves a prepared candidate firmware image after a reboot. It is :scterm:`implementation defined` whether a partially prepared image in in the staging area is retained after a system reset.

   See `PSA_FWU_FLAG_VOLATILE_STAGING`.

.. term:: Staging area

   A region within the firmware store used for a firmware image that is being transferred to the device. Once transfer is complete, the image in the staging area can be verified during installation.

   See :secref:`arch-firmware-store`.
