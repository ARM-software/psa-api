Key types
---------

Key type encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. typedef:: uint16_t psa_key_type_t

    .. summary::
        Encoding of a key type.

    This is a structured bit field that identifies the category and type of key. The range of key type values is divided as follows:

    :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_NONE == 0`
        Reserved as an invalid key type.
    :code:`0x0001 - 0x7fff`
        Specification-defined key types.
        Key types defined by this standard always have bit 15 clear.
        Unallocated key type values in this range are reserved for future use.
    :code:`0x8000 - 0xffff`
        Implementation-defined key types.
        Implementations that define additional key types must use an encoding with bit 15 set.
        The related support macros will be easier to write if these key encodings also respect the bitwise structure used by standard encodings.

    The :secref:`appendix-encodings` appendix provides a full definition of the key type encoding.

.. macro:: PSA_KEY_TYPE_NONE
    :definition: ((psa_key_type_t)0x0000)

    .. summary::
        An invalid key type value.

    Zero is not the encoding of any key type.

Key categories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the |API|, keys are typically used to store secrets that are specific to a set of related cryptographic algorithms.
Keys can also be used to store non-cryptographic secrets or other data.
The key type is used to identify what the key value is, and what can be used for.

*   :secref:`unstructured-keys` --- defines types for non-key data and unstructured symmetric keys.
    For example, passwords, key-derivation secrets, or AES keys.
*   :secref:`structured-keys` --- defines types for structured symmetric keys.
    For example, WPA3-SAE password tokens.
*   :secref:`asymmetric-keys` --- defines types for asymmetric keys.
    For example, elliptic curve or SPAKE2+ keys.

.. macro:: PSA_KEY_TYPE_IS_UNSTRUCTURED
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether a key type is an unstructured array of bytes.

    .. param:: type
        A key type: a value of type `psa_key_type_t`.

    This encompasses both symmetric keys and non-key data.

    See :secref:`unstructured-keys` for a list of unstructured key types.

.. macro:: PSA_KEY_TYPE_IS_ASYMMETRIC
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether a key type is asymmetric: either a key pair or a public key.

    .. param:: type
        A key type: a value of type `psa_key_type_t`.

    See :secref:`asymmetric-keys` for a list of asymmetric key types.

.. macro:: PSA_KEY_TYPE_IS_PUBLIC_KEY
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether a key type is the public part of a key pair.

    .. param:: type
        A key type: a value of type `psa_key_type_t`.

.. macro:: PSA_KEY_TYPE_IS_KEY_PAIR
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether a key type is a key pair containing a private part and a public part.

    .. param:: type
        A key type: a value of type `psa_key_type_t`.


Elliptic curve families
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. typedef:: uint8_t psa_ecc_family_t

    .. summary::
        The type of identifiers of an elliptic curve family.

    The curve family identifier is required to create a number of key types:

    *   ECC keys using `PSA_KEY_TYPE_ECC_KEY_PAIR()` or `PSA_KEY_TYPE_ECC_PUBLIC_KEY()`.
        These keys are used in various asymmetric signature, key-encapsulation, and key-agreement algorithms.
    *   SPAKE2+ keys using the `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_KEY_PAIR()` or `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_PUBLIC_KEY()`.
        These keys are used in the SPAKE2+ PAKE algorithms.
    *   WPA3-SAE password tokens using `PSA_KEY_TYPE_WPA3_SAE_ECC()`.
        These keys are used in the WPA3-SAE PAKE algorithms.

    Elliptic curve family identifiers are also used to construct PAKE primitives for cipher suites based on elliptic curve groups.
    See :secref:`pake-primitive`.

    The specific ECC curve within a family is identified by the ``key_bits`` attribute of the key.

    The range of elliptic curve family identifier values is divided as follows:

    :code:`0x00`
        Reserved.
        Not allocated to an elliptic curve family.
    :code:`0x01 - 0x7f`
        Elliptic curve family identifiers defined by this standard.
        Unallocated values in this range are reserved for future use.
    :code:`0x80 - 0xff`
        Invalid.
        Values in this range must not be used.

    The least significant bit of a elliptic curve family identifier is a parity bit for the whole key type.
    See :secref:`asymmetric-key-encoding` for details of the encoding of asymmetric key types.

    .. admonition:: Implementation note

        To provide other elliptic curve families, it is recommended that an implementation defines a key type with bit 15 set, which indicates an :scterm:`implementation defined` key type.

Finite field Diffie-Hellman families
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. typedef:: uint8_t psa_dh_family_t

    .. summary::
        The type of identifiers of a finite field Diffie-Hellman group family.

    The group family identifier is required to create a number of key types:

    .. summary::
        A low-entropy secret for password hashing or key derivation.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    This key type is suitable for passwords and passphrases which are typically intended to be memorizable by humans, and have a low entropy relative to their size.
    It can be used for randomly generated or derived keys with maximum or near-maximum entropy, but `PSA_KEY_TYPE_DERIVE` is more suitable for such keys.
    It is not suitable for passwords with extremely low entropy, such as numerical PINs.

    These keys can be used in the `PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_INPUT_PASSWORD` input step of key-derivation algorithms.
    Algorithms that accept such an input were designed to accept low-entropy secret and are known as *password hashing* or *key stretching* algorithms.

    These keys cannot be used in the `PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_INPUT_SECRET` input step of key-derivation algorithms, as the algorithms expect such an input to have high entropy.

    The key policy determines which key-derivation algorithm the key can be used for, among the permissible subset defined above.

Symmetric cryptographic keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. macro:: PSA_KEY_TYPE_HMAC
    :definition: ((psa_key_type_t)0x1100)

    .. summary::
        HMAC key.

    HMAC keys can be used in HMAC, or HMAC-based, algorithms.
    Although HMAC is parameterized by a specific hash algorithm, for example SHA-256, the hash algorithm is not specified in the key type.
    The permitted-algorithm policy for the key must specify a particular hash algorithm.

    The bit size of an HMAC key must be a non-zero multiple of 8.
    An HMAC key is typically the same size as the output of the underlying hash algorithm.
    An HMAC key that is longer than the block size of the underlying hash algorithm will be hashed before use, see :RFC-title:`2104#2`.

    It is recommended that an application does not construct HMAC keys that are longer than the block size of the hash algorithm that will be used.
    It is :scterm:`implementation defined` whether an HMAC key that is longer than the hash block size is supported.

WPA3-SAE password tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The WPA3-SAE PAKE defines two techniques for generating the password element used during the PAKE protocol.
The recommended hash-2-curve method is used to generate an intermediate password token, which is an element of the cyclic group used in the PAKE cipher suite.
The password token can be stored as a key object, and later used in the PAKE operation when performing the WPA3-SAE protocol.

WPA3-SAE password tokens are defined for both elliptic curve and finite field groups.

See :secref:`wpa3-sae-passwords`.

.. macro:: PSA_KEY_TYPE_WPA3_SAE_ECC
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        WPA3-SAE password token using elliptic curves.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4

    .. param:: curve
        A value of type `psa_ecc_family_t` that identifies the elliptic curve family to be used.

    The bit-size of a WPA3-SAE password token is the bit size associated with the specific curve within the elliptic curve family.
    See the documentation of the elliptic curve family for details.

    To construct a WPA3-SAE password token, it must be output from key derivation operation using the `PSA_ALG_WPA3_SAE_H2E` algorithm.

    .. note::

        To use a password token key with both `PSA_ALG_WPA3_SAE_FIXED` and `PSA_ALG_WPA3_SAE_GDH` algorithms, create the key with the wildcard `PSA_ALG_WPA3_SAE_ANY` permitted algorithm.

    .. subsection:: Key format

        The password token is an element of the elliptic curve group, with value :math:`(x,y)`.

        The data format for import and export of the password token is the concatenation of:

        *   :math:`x` encoded as a big-endian :math:`m`-byte string;
        *   :math:`y` encoded as a big-endian :math:`m`-byte string.

        For an elliptic curve over :math:`\mathbb{F}_p`, :math:`m` is the integer for which :math:`2^{8(m-1)} \leq p < 2^{8m}`.

        .. note::

            This is the same format as the one used for group elements in the commit phase of the WPA3-SAE protocol, defined in `[IEEE-802.11]` §12.4.7.2.4.

        .. rationale::

            There is no protocol use case for exporting or importing the password token.
            However, the ability to extract a derived token, or import a known-value token, can help development and testing of an implementation.

    .. subsection:: Key derivation

        A elliptic curve-based WPA3-SAE password token can only be derived using the `PSA_ALG_WPA3_SAE_H2E` algorithm.
        The call to `psa_key_derivation_output_key()` uses the  method defined in `[IEEE-802.11]` §12.4.4.2.3 to generate the key value.

.. _asymmetric-keys:

Asymmetric key types
--------------------

Asymmetric keys come in pairs.
One is a private or secret key, which must be kept confidential.
The other is a public key, which is meant to be shared with other participants in the protocol.

.. note::
    Depending on the type of cryptographic scheme, the private key can be referred to as the *prover key* or the *decapsulation key*, and the public key can be referred to as the *verifier key* or the *encapsulation key*.

The |API| defines the following types of asymmetric key:

*   :secref:`rsa-keys`
*   :secref:`ecc-keys`
*   :secref:`dh-keys`
*   :secref:`lms-keys`
*   :secref:`xmss-keys`
*   :secref:`ml-dsa-keys`
*   :secref:`slh-dsa-keys`
*   :secref:`ml-kem-keys`
*   :secref:`spake2p-keys`

In the |API|, key objects can either be a key pair, providing both the private and public key, or just a public key.
The difference in the key type values for a key pair and a public key for the same scheme is common across all asymmetric keys.

The `PSA_KEY_TYPE_KEY_PAIR_OF_PUBLIC_KEY()` and `PSA_KEY_TYPE_PUBLIC_KEY_OF_KEY_PAIR()` macros convert from one type to the other.

            Although it is possible to define an RSA key pair or private key using a subset of these elements, the output from `psa_export_key()` for an RSA key pair must include all of these elements.

        See `PSA_KEY_TYPE_RSA_PUBLIC_KEY` for the data format used when exporting the public key with `psa_export_public_key()`.

    .. subsection:: Key generation

        A call to `psa_generate_key()` will generate an RSA key-pair with the default public exponent of ``65537``. The modulus :math:`n=pq` is a product of two probabilistic primes :math:`p\ \text{and}\ q`, where :math:`2^{r-1} \le n < 2^r` and :math:`r` is the bit size specified in the attributes.

        The exponent can be explicitly specified in non-default production parameters in a call to `psa_generate_key_custom()`. Use the following custom production parameters:

        *   The production parameters structure, ``custom``, must have ``flags`` set to zero.

        *   If ``custom_data_length == 0``, the default exponent value ``65537`` is used.

        *   The additional production parameter buffer ``custom_data`` is the public exponent, in little-endian byte order.

            The exponent must be an odd integer greater than ``1``.
            An implementation must support an exponent of ``65537``, and is recommended to support an exponent of ``3``, and can support other values.

            The maximum supported exponent value is :scterm:`implementation defined`.

Elliptic curve keys are grouped into families of related curves.
A keys for a specific curve is specified by a combination of the elliptic curve family and the bit-size of the key.

There are three categories of elliptic curve key, shown in :numref:`tab-ecc-groups`.
The curve type affects the key format, the key-derivation procedure, and the algorithms which the key can be used with.

                    Let :math:`m` be the bit size of :math:`N`, such that :math:`2^{m-1} \leq N < 2^m`. This function generates the private key using the following process:

                    1.  Draw a byte string of length :math:`\lceil{m/8}\rceil` bytes.
                    #.  If :math:`m` is not a multiple of 8, set the most significant :math:`8 * \lceil{m/8}\rceil - m` bits of the first byte in the string to zero.
                    #.  Convert the string to integer :math:`k` by decoding it as a big-endian byte-string.
                    #.  If :math:`k > N-2`, discard the result and return to step 1.

        A finite field Diffie-Hellman private key is :math:`x \in [1, p - 1]`, where :math:`p` is the group's prime modulus.
        Let :math:`m` be the bit size of :math:`p`, such that :math:`2^{m-1} \leq p < 2^m`.

        This function generates the private key using the following process:

        1.  Draw a byte string of length :math:`\lceil{m/8}\rceil` bytes.
        #.  If :math:`m` is not a multiple of 8, set the most significant :math:`8 * \lceil{m/8}\rceil - m` bits of the first byte in the string to zero.
        #.  Convert the string to integer :math:`k` by decoding it as a big-endian byte-string.
        #.  If :math:`k > p-2`, discard the result and return to step 1.
        #.  Output :math:`x = k + 1` as the private key.

    .. subsection:: Key format

        An ML-DSA key pair is the :math:`(pk,sk)` pair of public key and secret key, which are generated from a secret 32-byte seed, :math:`\xi`. See `[FIPS204]` §5.1.

        In calls to :code:`psa_import_key()` and :code:`psa_export_key()`, the key-pair data format is the 32-byte seed :math:`\xi`.

        .. rationale::

            The formats for X.509 handling of ML-DSA keys are specified in :rfc-title:`9881`.
            This permits a choice of three formats for the decapsulation key material, incorporating one, or both, of the seed value :math:`\xi` and the expanded secret key :math:`sk`.

            The |API| only supports the recommended format from :rfc:`9881`, which is the bytes of the seed :math:`\xi`, but without the ASN.1 encoding prefix.
            This suits the constrained nature of |API| implementations, where interoperation with expanded secret-key formats is not required.

        See `PSA_KEY_TYPE_ML_DSA_PUBLIC_KEY` for the data format used when exporting the public key with :code:`psa_export_public_key()`.

        .. admonition:: Implementation note

            An implementation can optionally compute and store the :math:`(pk,sk)` values, to accelerate operations that use the key.
            It is recommended that an implementation retains the seed :math:`\xi` with the key pair, in order to export the key, or copy the key to a different location.

    .. subsection:: Key derivation

        A call to :code:`psa_key_derivation_output_key()` will draw 32 bytes of output and use these as the 32-byte ML-DSA key-pair seed, :math:`\xi`.
        The key pair :math:`(pk, sk)` is generated from the seed as defined by ``ML-DSA.KeyGen_internal()`` in `[FIPS204]` §6.1.

        .. admonition:: Implementation note

            It is :an implementation choice whether the seed :math:`\xi` is expanded to :math:`(pk, sk)` at the point of derivation, or only just before the key is used.

    .. summary::
        The type of identifiers of a Stateless hash-based DSA parameter set.

    The parameter-set identifier is required to create an SLH-DSA key using the `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SLH_DSA_KEY_PAIR()` or `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SLH_DSA_PUBLIC_KEY()` macros.

    The specific SLH-DSA parameter set within a family is identified by the ``key_bits`` attribute of the key.

    The range of SLH-DSA family identifier values is divided as follows:

    :code:`0x00`
        Reserved.
        Not allocated to an SLH-DSA parameter-set family.
    :code:`0x01 - 0x7f`
        SLH-DSA parameter-set family identifiers defined by this standard.
        Unallocated values in this range are reserved for future use.
    :code:`0x80 - 0xff`
        Invalid.
        Values in this range must not be used.

    The least significant bit of an SLH-DSA family identifier is a parity bit for the whole key type.
    See :secref:`slh-dsa-key-encoding` for details of the encoding of asymmetric key types.

    That is, for a parameter set with security parameter :math:`n`, the bit-size in the key attributes is :math:`8n`.

    The bit size used in the attributes of an ML-KEM key is specified by the numeric part of the parameter-set identifier defined in `[FIPS203]`.
    The parameter-set identifier refers to the key strength, and not to the actual size of the key.
    The following values for the ``key_bits`` key attribute are used to select a specific ML-KEM parameter set:

    *   ML-KEM-512 : ``key_bits = 512``
    *   ML-KEM-768 : ``key_bits = 768``
    *   ML-KEM-1024 : ``key_bits = 1024``

    See also §8 in `[FIPS203]`.

    .. subsection:: Key format

        An ML-KEM key pair is the :math:`(ek,dk)` pair of encapsulation key and decapsulation key, which are generated from two secret 32-byte seeds, :math:`d` and :math:`z`. See `[FIPS203]` §7.1.

        In calls to :code:`psa_import_key()` and :code:`psa_export_key()`, the key-pair data format is the concatenation of the two seed values: :math:`d\ ||\ z`.

        .. rationale::

            The formats for X.509 handling of ML-KEM keys are specified in :cite-title:`LAMPS-MLKEM`.
            This permits a choice of three formats for the decapsulation key material, incorporating one, or both, of the seed values :math:`d\ ||\ z` and the expanded decapsulation key :math:`dk`.

            The |API| only supports the recommended format from `[LAMPS-MLKEM]`, which is the concatenated bytes of the seed values :math:`d\ ||\ z`, but without the ASN.1 encoding prefix.
            This suits the constrained nature of |API| implementations, where interoperation with expanded decapsulation-key formats is not required.

        See `PSA_KEY_TYPE_ML_KEM_PUBLIC_KEY` for the data format used when exporting the public key with :code:`psa_export_public_key()`.

        .. admonition:: Implementation note

            An implementation can optionally compute and store the :math:`dk` value, which also contains the encapsulation key :math:`ek`, to accelerate operations that use the key.
            It is recommended that an implementation retains the seed pair :math:`(d,z)` with the decapsulation key, in order to export the key, or copy the key to a different location.

    .. subsection:: Key derivation

        A call to :code:`psa_key_derivation_output_key()` will construct an ML-KEM key pair using the following process:

        1.  Draw 32 bytes of output as the seed value :math:`d`.
        #.  Draw 32 bytes of output as the seed value :math:`z`.

        The key pair :math:`(ek,dk)` is generated from the seed as defined by ``ML-KEM.KeyGen_internal()`` in `[FIPS203]` §6.1.

        .. admonition:: Implementation note

            It is an implementation choice whether the seed-pair :math:`(d,z)` is expanded to :math:`(ek,dk)` at the point of derivation, or only just before the key is used.

        An ML-KEM public key is the :math:`ek` output of ``ML-KEM.KeyGen()``, defined in `[FIPS203]` §7.1.

        In calls to :code:`psa_import_key()`, :code:`psa_export_key()`, and :code:`psa_export_public_key()`, the public-key data format is :math:`ek`.

        .. rationale::

            This format is the same as that specified for X.509 in :cite-title:`LAMPS-MLKEM`.

        The size of the public key depends on the ML-KEM parameter set as follows:

    .. param:: curve
        A value of type :code:`psa_ecc_family_t` that identifies the elliptic curve family to be used.

    The bit-size of a SPAKE2+ key is the size associated with the elliptic curve group, that is, :math:`\lceil{log_2(q)}\rceil` for a curve over a field :math:`\mathbb{F}_q`.
    See :secref:`ecc-keys` for details of each elliptic curve family.

    To create a new SPAKE2+ key pair, use :code:`psa_key_derivation_output_key()` as described in :secref:`spake2p-registration`.
    The SPAKE2+ protocol recommends that a key-stretching key-derivation function, such as PBKDF2, is used to hash the SPAKE2+ password.
    This follows the recommended process described in :rfc:`9383`.

    A SPAKE2+ key pair can also be imported from a previously exported SPAKE2+ key pair.

    The corresponding public key can be exported using :code:`psa_export_public_key()`.
    See also `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_PUBLIC_KEY()`.

    .. subsection:: Key format

        A SPAKE2+ key pair consists of the two values :math:`w0` and :math:`w1`, which result from the SPAKE2+ registration phase, see :secref:`spake2p-registration`.
        :math:`w0` and :math:`w1` are scalars in the same range as an elliptic curve private key from the group used as the SPAKE2+ primitive group.

        The data format for import and export of the key pair is the concatenation of the formatted values for :math:`w0` and :math:`w1`, using the standard formats for elliptic curve keys used by the |API|.
        For example, for SPAKE2+ over P-256 (secp256r1), the output from :code:`psa_export_key()` would be the concatenation of:

        *   The P-256 private key :math:`w0`.
            This is a 32-byte big-endian encoding of the integer :math:`w0`.
        *   The P-256 private key :math:`w1`.
            This is a 32-byte big-endian encoding of the integer :math:`w1`.

        See `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_PUBLIC_KEY` for the data format used when exporting the public key with `psa_export_public_key()`.

    .. subsection:: Key derivation

        A call to `psa_key_derivation_output_key()` will use the following process, which follows the recommendations for the registration process in :rfc-title:`9383`, and matches the specification of this process in :cite-title:`MATTER`.

        The derivation of SPAKE2+ keys extracts :math:`\lceil{log_2(p)/8}\rceil+8` bytes from the PBKDF for each of :math:`w0s` and :math:`w1s`, where :math:`p` is the prime factor of the order of the elliptic curve group.
        The following sizes are used for extracting :math:`w0s` and :math:`w1s`, depending on the elliptic curve:

        *   P-256: 40 bytes
        *   P-384: 56 bytes
        *   P-521: 74 bytes
        *   edwards25519: 40 bytes
        *   edwards448: 64 bytes

        The calculation of :math:`w0`, :math:`w1`, and :math:`L` then proceeds as described in :rfc:`9383`.

        .. admonition:: Implementation note

            The values of :math:`w0` and :math:`w1` are required as part of the SPAKE2+ key pair.

            It is :scterm:`implementation defined` whether :math:`L` is computed during key derivation, and stored as part of the key pair; or only computed when required from the key pair.

        A SPAKE2+ public key consists of the two values :math:`w0` and :math:`L`, which result from the SPAKE2+ registration phase, see :secref:`spake2p-registration`.
        :math:`w0` is a scalar in the same range as a elliptic curve private key from the group used as the SPAKE2+ primitive group.
        :math:`L` is a point on the curve, similar to a public key from the same group, corresponding to the :math:`w1` value in the key pair.

        The data format for import and export of the public key is the concatenation of the formatted values for :math:`w0` and :math:`L`, using the standard formats for elliptic curve keys used by the |API|.
