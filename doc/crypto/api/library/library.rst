Library initialization
----------------------

.. function:: psa_crypto_init

    .. summary::
        Library initialization.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_ENTROPY

    It is recommended that applications call this function before calling any other function in this module.

    Applications are permitted to call this function more than once. Once a call succeeds, subsequent calls are guaranteed to succeed.

    If the application calls any function that returns a :code:`psa_status_t` result code before calling `psa_crypto_init()`, the following will occur:

    *   If initialization of the library is essential for secure operation of the function, the implementation must return :code:`PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE` or other appropriate error.

    *   If failure to initialize the library does not compromise the security of the function, the implementation must either provide the expected result for the function, or return :code:`PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE` or other appropriate error.

    .. note::

        The following scenarios are examples where an implementation can require that the library has been initialized by calling `psa_crypto_init()`:

        *   A client-server implementation, in which `psa_crypto_init()` establishes the communication with the server. No key management or cryptographic operation can be performed until this is done.

        *   An implementation in which `psa_crypto_init()` initializes the random bit generator, and no operations that require the RNG can be performed until this is done. For example, random data, key, IV, or nonce generation; randomized signature or encryption; and algorithms that are implemented with blinding.

    .. warning::
        The set of functions that depend on successful initialization of the library is :scterm:`IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED`. Applications that rely on calling functions before initializing the library might not be portable to other implementations.
