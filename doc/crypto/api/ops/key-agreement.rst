Key agreement
=============

Three functions are provided for a Diffie-Hellman-style key agreement where each party combines its own private key with the peer’s public key, to produce a shared secret value:

*   A call to `psa_key_agreement()` will compute the shared secret and store the result in a new derivation key.

*   If the resulting shared secret will be used for a single key derivation, a :ref:`key-derivation operation <kdf>` can be used with the `psa_key_derivation_key_agreement()` input function. This calculates the shared secret and inputs it directly to the key-derivation operation.

*   Where an application needs direct access to the shared secret, it can call `psa_raw_key_agreement()` instead.

Using `psa_key_agreement()` or `psa_key_derivation_key_agreement()` is recommended, as these do not expose the shared secret to the application.

.. note::

    In general the shared secret is not directly suitable for use as a key because it is biased.

Key-agreement algorithms
------------------------

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_FFDH
    :definition: ((psa_algorithm_t)0x09010000)

    .. summary::
        The finite-field Diffie-Hellman (DH) key-agreement algorithm.

    This standalone key-agreement algorithm can be used directly in a call to `psa_key_agreement()` or `psa_raw_key_agreement()`, or combined with a key-derivation operation using `PSA_ALG_KEY_AGREEMENT()` for use with `psa_key_derivation_key_agreement()`.

    When used as a key's permitted-algorithm policy, the following uses are permitted:

    *   In a call to `psa_key_agreement()` or `psa_raw_key_agreement()`, with algorithm `PSA_ALG_FFDH`.
    *   In a call to `psa_key_derivation_key_agreement()`, with any combined key-agreement and key-derivation algorithm constructed with `PSA_ALG_FFDH`.

    When used as part of a multi-part key-derivation operation, this implements a Diffie-Hellman key-agreement scheme using a single Diffie-Hellman key pair for each participant. This includes the *dhEphem*, *dhOneFlow*, and *dhStatic* schemes. The input step `PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_INPUT_SECRET` is used when providing the secret and peer keys to the operation.

    The shared secret produced by this key-agreement algorithm is :math:`g^{ab}` in big-endian format. It is :math:`\lceil{(m / 8)}\rceil` bytes long where :math:`m` is the size of the prime :math:`p` in bits.

    This key-agreement scheme is defined by :cite-title:`SP800-56A` §5.7.1.1 under the name FFC DH.

        | `PSA_KEY_TYPE_DH_KEY_PAIR()`

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_ECDH
    :definition: ((psa_algorithm_t)0x09020000)

    .. summary::
        The elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key-agreement algorithm.

    This standalone key-agreement algorithm can be used directly in a call to `psa_key_agreement()` or `psa_raw_key_agreement()`, or combined with a key-derivation operation using `PSA_ALG_KEY_AGREEMENT()` for use with `psa_key_derivation_key_agreement()`.

    When used as a key's permitted-algorithm policy, the following uses are permitted:

    *   In a call to `psa_key_agreement()` or `psa_raw_key_agreement()`, with algorithm `PSA_ALG_ECDH`.
    *   In a call to `psa_key_derivation_key_agreement()`, with any combined key-agreement and key-derivation algorithm constructed with `PSA_ALG_ECDH`.

    When used as part of a multi-part key-derivation operation, this implements a Diffie-Hellman key-agreement scheme using a single elliptic curve key pair for each participant. This includes the *Ephemeral unified model*, the *Static unified model*, and the *One-pass Diffie-Hellman* schemes. The input step `PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_INPUT_SECRET` is used when providing the secret and peer keys to the operation.

    The shared secret produced by key agreement is the x-coordinate of the shared secret point. It is always :math:`\lceil{(m / 8)}\rceil` bytes long where :math:`m` is the bit size associated with the curve, i.e. the bit size of the order of the curve's coordinate field. When :math:`m` is not a multiple of 8, the byte containing the most significant bit of the shared secret is padded with zero bits. The byte order is either little-endian or big-endian depending on the curve type.

    *   For Montgomery curves (curve family `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_MONTGOMERY`), the shared secret is the x-coordinate of :math:`Z = d_A Q_B = d_B Q_A` in little-endian byte order.

        -   For Curve25519, this is the X25519 function defined in :cite-title:`Curve25519`. The bit size :math:`m` is 255.
        -   For Curve448, this is the X448 function defined in :cite-title:`Curve448`. The bit size :math:`m` is 448.

    *   For Weierstrass curves (curve families ``PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_XX``, ``PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECT_XX``, `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_BRAINPOOL_P_R1` and `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_FRP`) the shared secret is the x-coordinate of :math:`Z = h d_A Q_B = h d_B Q_A` in big-endian byte order. This is the Elliptic Curve Cryptography Cofactor Diffie-Hellman primitive defined by :cite-title:`SEC1` §3.3.2 as, and also as ECC CDH by :cite-title:`SP800-56A` §5.7.1.2.

        -   Over prime fields (curve families ``PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_XX``, `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_BRAINPOOL_P_R1` and `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_FRP`), the bit size is :math:`m = \lceil{\log_2(p)}\rceil` for the field :math:`\mathbb{F}_p`.
        -   Over binary fields (curve families ``PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECT_XX``), the bit size is :math:`m` for the field :math:`\mathbb{F}_{2^m}`.

        .. note::

            The cofactor Diffie-Hellman primitive is equivalent to the standard elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman calculation :math:`Z = d_A Q_B = d_B Q_A` (`[SEC1]` §3.3.1) for curves where the cofactor :math:`h` is 1. This is true for all curves in the ``PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_XX``, `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_BRAINPOOL_P_R1`, and `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_FRP` families.

    .. subsection:: Compatible key types

        | :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_ECC_KEY_PAIR(family)`

        where ``family`` is a Weierstrass or Montgomery Elliptic curve family. That is, one of the following values:

        *   ``PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECT_XX``
        *   ``PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_XX``
        *   `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_FRP`
        *   `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_BRAINPOOL_P_R1`
        *   `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_MONTGOMERY`

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_KEY_AGREEMENT

    .. summary::
        Macro to build a combined algorithm that chains a key agreement with a key derivation.

    .. param:: ka_alg
        A key-agreement algorithm: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_KEY_AGREEMENT(ka_alg)` is true.
    .. param:: kdf_alg
        A key-derivation algorithm: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_KEY_DERIVATION(kdf_alg)` is true.

    .. return::
        The corresponding key-agreement and key-derivation algorithm.

        Unspecified if ``ka_alg`` is not a supported key-agreement algorithm or ``kdf_alg`` is not a supported key-derivation algorithm.

    A combined key-agreement algorithm is used with a multi-part key-derivation operation, using a call to `psa_key_derivation_key_agreement()`.

    The component parts of a key-agreement algorithm can be extracted using `PSA_ALG_KEY_AGREEMENT_GET_BASE()` and `PSA_ALG_KEY_AGREEMENT_GET_KDF()`.

    .. subsection:: Compatible key types

        The resulting combined key-agreement algorithm is compatible with the same key types as the standalone key-agreement algorithm used to construct it.


Standalone key agreement
------------------------

.. function:: psa_key_agreement

    .. summary::
        Perform a key agreement and return the shared secret as a derivation key.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    .. param:: psa_key_id_t private_key
        Identifier of the private key to use.
        It must permit the usage `PSA_KEY_USAGE_DERIVE`.
    .. param:: const uint8_t * peer_key
        Public key of the peer. The peer key data is parsed with the type :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_PUBLIC_KEY_OF_KEY_PAIR(type)` where ``type`` is the type of ``private_key``, and with the same bit-size as ``private_key``. The peer key must be in the format that `psa_import_key()` accepts for this public-key type. These formats are described with the public-key type in :secref:`key-types`.
    .. param:: size_t peer_key_length
        Size of ``peer_key`` in bytes.

    .. param:: const psa_key_attributes_t * attributes
        The attributes for the new key.

        The following attributes are required for all keys:

        *   The key type, which must be one of `PSA_KEY_TYPE_DERIVE`, `PSA_KEY_TYPE_RAW_DATA`, `PSA_KEY_TYPE_HMAC`, or `PSA_KEY_TYPE_PASSWORD`.

            Implementations must support the `PSA_KEY_TYPE_DERIVE` and `PSA_KEY_TYPE_RAW_DATA` key types.

        The following attributes must be set for keys used in cryptographic operations:

        *   The key permitted-algorithm policy, see :secref:`permitted-algorithms`.
        *   The key usage flags, see :secref:`key-usage-flags`.

        The following attributes must be set for keys that do not use the default `PSA_KEY_LIFETIME_VOLATILE` lifetime:

        *   The key lifetime, see :secref:`key-lifetimes`.
        *   The key identifier is required for a key with a persistent lifetime, see :secref:`key-identifiers`.

        The following attributes are optional:

        *   If the key size is nonzero, it must be equal to the output size of the key agreement, in bits.

            The output size, in bits, of the key agreement is :code:`8 * PSA_RAW_KEY_AGREEMENT_OUTPUT_SIZE(type, bits)`, where ``type`` and ``bits`` are the type and bit-size of ``private_key``.

        .. note::
            This is an input parameter: it is not updated with the final key attributes.
            The final attributes of the new key can be queried by calling `psa_get_key_attributes()` with the key's identifier.

    .. param:: psa_key_id_t * key
        On success, an identifier for the newly created key. `PSA_KEY_ID_NULL` on failure.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success.
        The new key contains the share secret.
        If the key is persistent, the key material and the key's metadata have been saved to persistent storage.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE
        ``private_key`` is not a valid key identifier.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   ``private_key`` does not have the `PSA_KEY_USAGE_DERIVE` flag, or it does not permit the requested algorithm.
        *   The implementation does not permit creating a key with the specified attributes due to some implementation-specific policy.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS
        This is an attempt to create a persistent key, and there is already a persistent key with the given identifier.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   ``alg`` is not a key-agreement algorithm.

        *   ``peer_key`` is not a valid public key corresponding to ``private_key``.
        *   The output key attributes in ``attributes`` are not valid :

            -   The key type is not valid for key-agreement output.
            -   The key size is nonzero, and is not the size of the shared secret.
            -   The key lifetime is invalid.
            -   The key identifier is not valid for the key lifetime.
            -   The key usage flags include invalid values.
            -   The key's permitted-usage algorithm is invalid.
            -   The key attributes, as a whole, are invalid.

    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   ``alg`` is not supported or is not a key-agreement algorithm.
        *   ``private_key`` is not supported for use with ``alg``.
        *   The output key attributes, as a whole, are not supported, either by the implementation in general or in the specified storage location.

        The library requires initializing by a call to `psa_crypto_init()`.

    A key-agreement algorithm takes two inputs: a private key ``private_key``, and a public key ``peer_key``.
    The result of this function is a shared secret, returned as a derivation key.

    The new key's location, policy, and type are taken from ``attributes``.

    The size of the returned key is always the bit-size of the shared secret, rounded up to a whole number of bytes.

    This key can be used as input to a key-derivation operation using `psa_key_derivation_input_key()`.

    .. warning::
        The shared secret resulting from a key-agreement algorithm such as finite-field Diffie-Hellman or elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman has biases. This makes it unsuitable for use as key material, for example, as an AES key. Instead, it is recommended that a key-derivation algorithm is applied to the result, to derive unbiased cryptographic keys.

        Buffer where the shared secret is to be written.
    .. param:: size_t output_size
        Size of the ``output`` buffer in bytes.
        This must be appropriate for the keys:

        *   The required output size is :code:`PSA_RAW_KEY_AGREEMENT_OUTPUT_SIZE(type, bits)`, where ``type`` and ``bits`` are the type and bit-size of ``private_key``.
        *   `PSA_RAW_KEY_AGREEMENT_OUTPUT_MAX_SIZE` evaluates to the maximum output size of any supported standalone key-agreement algorithm.

        The size of the ``output`` buffer is too small.
        `PSA_RAW_KEY_AGREEMENT_OUTPUT_SIZE()` or `PSA_RAW_KEY_AGREEMENT_OUTPUT_MAX_SIZE` can be used to determine a sufficient buffer size.

        To chain a key agreement with a key derivation, either use `psa_key_agreement()` to obtain the result of the key agreement as a derivation key, or use `psa_key_derivation_key_agreement()` and other functions from the key-derivation interface.

Combining key agreement and key derivation

    .. summary::
        Perform a key agreement and use the shared secret as input to a key derivation.

    .. param:: psa_key_derivation_operation_t * operation

    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The operation state is not valid for this key-agreement ``step``.
        *   The library requires initializing by a call to `psa_crypto_init()`.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE

    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_INVALID

    A key-agreement algorithm takes two inputs: a private key ``private_key``, and a public key ``peer_key``. The result of this function is a shared secret, which is directly input to the key-derivation operation. Output from the key-derivation operation can then be used as keys and other cryptographic material.

    If this function returns an error status, the operation enters an error state and must be aborted by calling `psa_key_derivation_abort()`.

    .. note::

        This function cannot be used when the resulting shared secret is required for multiple key derivations.

        Instead, the application can call `psa_key_agreement()` to obtain the shared secret as a derivation key. This key can be used as input to as many key-derivation operations as required.

    This includes the standalone finite field Diffie-Hellman algorithm, as well as finite-field Diffie-Hellman combined with any supported key-derivation algorithm.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_IS_ECDH
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether the specified algorithm is an elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman algorithm.

    .. param:: alg
        An algorithm identifier: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t`.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` is an elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman algorithm, ``0`` otherwise. This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported key-agreement algorithm identifier.

    This includes the standalone elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman algorithm, as well as elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman combined with any supported key-derivation algorithm.

.. macro:: PSA_RAW_KEY_AGREEMENT_OUTPUT_SIZE
    :definition: /* implementation-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Sufficient output buffer size for `psa_raw_key_agreement()`.

    .. param:: key_type
        A supported key type.
    .. param:: key_bits
        The size of the key in bits.

    .. return::
        A sufficient output buffer size for the specified key type and size. An implementation can return either ``0`` or a correct size for a key type and size that it recognizes, but does not support. If the parameters are not valid, the return value is unspecified.

    If the size of the output buffer is at least this large, it is guaranteed that `psa_raw_key_agreement()` will not fail due to an insufficient buffer size. The actual size of the output might be smaller in any given call.

    See also `PSA_RAW_KEY_AGREEMENT_OUTPUT_MAX_SIZE`.

.. macro:: PSA_RAW_KEY_AGREEMENT_OUTPUT_MAX_SIZE
    :definition: /* implementation-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Sufficient output buffer size for `psa_raw_key_agreement()`, for any of the supported key types and key-agreement algorithms.

    If the size of the output buffer is at least this large, it is guaranteed that `psa_raw_key_agreement()` will not fail due to an insufficient buffer size.
