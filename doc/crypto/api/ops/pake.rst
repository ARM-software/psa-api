Password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE)
==========================================

PAKE protocols provide an interactive method for two or more parties to establish cryptographic keys based on knowledge of a low entropy secret, such as a password.

These can provide strong security for communication from a weak password, because the password is not directly communicated as part of the key exchange.

This chapter is divided into the following sections:

*   :secref:`pake-common-api` --- the common interface elements, including the PAKE operation.
*   :secref:`pake-jpake` --- the J-PAKE protocol, and the associated interface elements.
*   :secref:`pake-spake2p` --- the SPAKE2+ protocols, and the associated interface elements.

.. _pake-common-api:

PAKE primitives
---------------

A PAKE algorithm specifies a sequence of interactions between the participants.
Many PAKE algorithms are designed to allow different cryptographic primitives to be used for the key establishment operation, so long as all the participants are using the same underlying cryptography.

The cryptographic primitive for a PAKE operation is specified using a `psa_pake_primitive_t` value, which can be constructed using the `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()` macro, or can be provided as a numerical constant value.

A PAKE primitive is required when constructing a PAKE cipher-suite object, `psa_pake_cipher_suite_t`, which fully specifies the PAKE operation to be carried out.

.. typedef:: uint32_t psa_pake_primitive_t

    .. summary::
        Encoding of the primitive associated with the PAKE.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    PAKE primitive values are constructed using `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

    :numref:`fig-pake-primitive` shows how the components of the primitive are encoded into a `psa_pake_primitive_t` value.

    .. figure:: /figure/pake/pake_primitive.*
        :name: fig-pake-primitive

        PAKE primitive encoding

    .. rationale::

        An integral type is required for `psa_pake_primitive_t` to enable values of this type to be compile-time-constants.
        This allows them to be used in ``case`` statements, and used to calculate static buffer sizes with `PSA_PAKE_OUTPUT_SIZE()` and `PSA_PAKE_INPUT_SIZE()`.

    The components of a PAKE primitive value can be extracted using the `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_GET_TYPE()`, `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_GET_FAMILY()`, and `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_GET_BITS()`.
    These can be used to set key attributes for keys used in PAKE algorithms.
    :secref:`spake2p-registration` provides an example of this usage.

    .. summary::
        Encoding of the type of the PAKE's primitive.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    The range of PAKE primitive type values is divided as follows:

    :code:`0x00`
        Reserved as an invalid primitive type.
    :code:`0x01 - 0x7f`
        Specification-defined primitive type.
        Primitive types defined by this standard always have bit 7 clear.
        Unallocated primitive type values in this range are reserved for future use.
    :code:`0x80 - 0xff`
        Implementation-defined primitive type.
        Implementations that define additional primitive types must use an encoding with bit 7 set.

    For specification-defined primitive types, see `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC` and `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_DH`.

.. _pake-cipher-suite:

PAKE cipher suites
------------------

Most PAKE algorithms have parameters that must be specified by the application.
These parameters include the following:

*   The cryptographic primitive used for key establishment, specified using a `PAKE primitive <pake-primitive>`.
*   A cryptographic hash algorithm.
*   Whether the application requires the shared secret before, or after, it is confirmed.

The hash algorithm is encoded into the PAKE algorithm identifier. The `psa_pake_cipher_suite_t` object is used to fully specify a PAKE operation, combining the PAKE protocol with all of the above parameters.

A PAKE cipher suite is required when setting up a PAKE operation in `psa_pake_setup()`.


.. typedef:: /* implementation-defined type */ psa_pake_cipher_suite_t

    .. summary::
        The type of an object describing a PAKE cipher suite.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    This is the object that represents the cipher suite used for a PAKE algorithm.
    The PAKE cipher suite specifies the PAKE algorithm, and the options selected for that algorithm.
    The cipher suite includes the following attributes:

    *   The PAKE algorithm itself.
    *   The hash algorithm, encoded within the PAKE algorithm.
    *   The PAKE primitive, which identifies the prime order group used for the key exchange operation.
        See :secref:`pake-primitive`.
    *   Whether to confirm the shared secret.

    This is an implementation-defined type.
    Applications that make assumptions about the content of this object will result in implementation-specific behavior, and are non-portable.

    Before calling any function on a PAKE cipher suite object, the application must initialize it by any of the following means:

    *   Set the object to all-bits-zero, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite;
            memset(&cipher_suite, 0, sizeof(cipher_suite));

    *   Initialize the object to logical zero values by declaring the object as static or global without an explicit initializer, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            static psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite;

    *   Initialize the object to the initializer `PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT`, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite = PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT;

    *   Assign the result of the function `psa_pake_cipher_suite_init()` to the object, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite;
            cipher_suite = psa_pake_cipher_suite_init();

    Following initialization, the cipher-suite object contains the following values:

    .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        :widths: 1 4
        :align: left

        *   -   Attribute
            -   Value

        *   -   algorithm
            -   :code:`PSA_ALG_NONE` --- an invalid algorithm identifier.
        *   -   primitive
            -   ``0`` --- an invalid PAKE primitive.
        *   -   key confirmation
            -   `PSA_PAKE_CONFIRMED_KEY` --- requesting that the secret key is confirmed before it can be returned.

    Valid algorithm, primitive, and key confirmation values must be set when using a PAKE cipher suite.

    .. admonition:: Implementation note

        Implementations are recommended to define the cipher-suite object as a simple data structure, with fields corresponding to the individual cipher suite attributes.
        In such an implementation, each function ``psa_pake_cs_set_xxx()`` sets a field and the corresponding function ``psa_pake_cs_get_xxx()`` retrieves the value of the field.

        An implementation can report attribute values that are equivalent to the original one, but have a different encoding.
        For example, an implementation can use a more compact representation for attributes where many bit-patterns are invalid or not supported, and store all values that it does not support as a special marker value.
        In such an implementation, after setting an invalid value, the corresponding get function returns an invalid value which might not be the one that was originally stored.

.. _pake-roles:

PAKE roles
----------

Some PAKE algorithms need to know which role each participant is taking in the algorithm.

    The format for both input and output using this step is the same as the format for public keys on the group specified by the PAKE operation's primitive.

    The public-key formats are defined in the documentation for :code:`psa_export_public_key()`.

    For information regarding how the group is determined, consult the documentation `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

.. macro:: PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC

    This is the ephemeral public key in the Schnorr Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof, this is the value denoted by *V* in :RFC:`8235`.

    The format for both input and output at this step is the same as that for public keys on the group specified by the PAKE operation's primitive.

    For more information on the format, consult the documentation of :code:`psa_export_public_key()`.

    For information regarding how the group is determined, consult the documentation `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE()`.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    This is the proof in the Schnorr Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof, this is the value denoted by *r* in :RFC:`8235`.

    Both for input and output, the value at this step is an integer less than the order of the group specified by the PAKE operation's primitive.
    The format depends on the group as well:

    *   For Montgomery curves, the encoding is little endian.
    *   For other elliptic curves, and for Diffie-Hellman groups, the encoding is big endian. See :cite:`SEC1` §2.3.8.

    In both cases leading zeroes are permitted as long as the length in bytes does not exceed the byte length of the group order.

    This value is used during the key confirmation phase of a PAKE protocol. The format of the value depends on the algorithm and cipher suite:

    *   For :code:`PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P`, the format for both input and output at this step is the same as the output of the MAC algorithm specified in the cipher suite.

    *   Initialize the object to logical zero values by declaring the object as static or global without an explicit initializer, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            static psa_pake_operation_t operation;

    *   Initialize the object to the initializer `PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT`, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_pake_operation_t operation = PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT;

    *   Assign the result of the function `psa_pake_operation_init()` to the object, for example:

            operation = psa_pake_operation_init();

    This is an implementation-defined type.
    Applications that make assumptions about the content of this object will result in implementation-specific behavior, and are non-portable.

    .. param:: psa_pake_operation_t * operation
        The operation object to set up.
        It must have been initialized as per the documentation for `psa_pake_operation_t` and not yet in use.
    .. param:: psa_key_id_t password_key
        Identifier of the key holding the password or a value derived from the password.
        It must remain valid until the operation terminates.

        The valid key types depend on the PAKE algorithm, and participant role.
        Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for more information.

        The key must permit the usage :code:`PSA_KEY_USAGE_DERIVE`.
    .. param:: const psa_pake_cipher_suite_t * cipher_suite
        The cipher suite to use.
        A PAKE cipher suite fully characterizes a PAKE algorithm, including the PAKE algorithm.

        The cipher suite must be compatible with the key type of ``password_key``.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success. The operation is now active.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The operation state is not valid: it must be inactive.
        *   The library requires initializing by a call to :code:`psa_crypto_init()`.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE
        ``password_key`` is not a valid key identifier.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED
        ``psssword_key`` does not have the :code:`PSA_KEY_USAGE_DERIVE` flag, or it does not permit the algorithm in ``cipher_suite``.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The algorithm in ``cipher_suite`` is not a PAKE algorithm, or encodes an invalid hash algorithm.
        *   The PAKE primitive in ``cipher_suite`` is not compatible with the PAKE algorithm.
        *   The key confirmation value in ``cipher_suite`` is not compatible with the PAKE algorithm and primitive.
        *   The key type or key size of ``password_key`` is not compatible with ``cipher_suite``.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The algorithm in ``cipher_suite`` is not a supported PAKE algorithm, or encodes an unsupported hash algorithm.
        *   The PAKE primitive in ``cipher_suite`` is not supported or not compatible with the PAKE algorithm.
        *   The key confirmation value in ``cipher_suite`` is not supported, or not compatible, with the PAKE algorithm and primitive.
        *   The key type or key size of ``password_key`` is not supported with ``cipher suite``.

    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_INVALID

    The sequence of operations to set up a password-authenticated key exchange operation is as follows:

    1.  Allocate a PAKE operation object which will be passed to all the functions listed here.
    #.  Initialize the operation object with one of the methods described in the documentation for `psa_pake_operation_t`.
        For example, using `PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT`.
    #.  Call `psa_pake_setup()` to specify the cipher suite.
    #.  Call ``psa_pake_set_xxx()`` functions on the operation to complete the setup.
        The exact sequence of ``psa_pake_set_xxx()`` functions that needs to be called depends on the algorithm in use.

    A typical sequence of calls to perform a password-authenticated key exchange:

    1.  Call :code:`psa_pake_output(operation, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...)` to get the key share that needs to be sent to the peer.
    #.  Call :code:`psa_pake_input(operation, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...)` to provide the key share that was received from the peer.
    #.  Depending on the algorithm additional calls to `psa_pake_output()` and `psa_pake_input()` might be necessary.
    #.  Call `psa_pake_get_shared_key()` to access the shared secret.

    Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for details on the required set up and operation for each algorithm, and for constraints on the format and content of valid passwords.

    After a successful call to `psa_pake_setup()`, the operation is active, and the application must eventually terminate the operation.
    The following events terminate an operation:

    *   A successful call to `psa_pake_get_shared_key()`.
    *   A call to `psa_pake_abort()`.

    If `psa_pake_setup()` returns an error, the operation object is unchanged.
    If a subsequent function call with an active operation returns an error, the operation enters an error state.

    To abandon an active operation, or reset an operation in an error state, call `psa_pake_abort()`.

    See :secref:`multi-part-operations`.

    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED

    Not all PAKE algorithms need to differentiate the communicating participants.

        Active PAKE operation.
    .. param:: const psa_key_attributes_t * attributes
        The attributes for the new key.

        The following attributes are required for all keys:

        *   The key type.
            All PAKE algorithms can output a key of type :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_DERIVE` or :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_HMAC`.

            Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for more information.

        The following attributes must be set for keys used in cryptographic operations:

        *   The key permitted-algorithm policy, see :secref:`permitted-algorithms`.
        *   The key usage flags, see :secref:`key-usage-flags`.

        The following attributes must be set for keys that do not use the default `PSA_KEY_LIFETIME_VOLATILE` lifetime:

        *   The key lifetime, see :secref:`key-lifetimes`.
        *   The key identifier is required for a key with a persistent lifetime, see :secref:`key-identifiers`.

        The following attributes are optional:

        *   If the key size is nonzero, it must be equal to the size of the PAKE shared secret.

        .. note::
            This is an input parameter: it is not updated with the final key attributes.
            The final attributes of the new key can be queried by calling `psa_get_key_attributes()` with the key's identifier.

    .. param:: psa_key_id_t * key
        On success, an identifier for the newly created key. :code:`PSA_KEY_ID_NULL` on failure.

    .. return:: psa_status_t

        Success.
        If the key is persistent, the key material and the key's metadata have been saved to persistent storage.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The state of PAKE operation ``operation`` is not valid: it must be ready to return the shared secret.

            For an unconfirmed key, this will be when the key-exchange output and input steps are complete, but prior to any key-confirmation output and input steps.

            For a confirmed key, this will be when all key-exchange and key-confirmation output and input steps are complete.
        *   The library requires initializing by a call to :code:`psa_crypto_init()`.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS
        This is an attempt to create a persistent key, and there is already a persistent key with the given identifier.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
        The key attributes, as a whole, are not supported for creation from a PAKE secret, either by the implementation in general or in the specified storage location.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The key type is not valid for output from this operation's algorithm.
        *   The key size is nonzero.
        *   The key lifetime is invalid.
        *   The key identifier is not valid for the key lifetime.
        *   The key usage flags include invalid values.
        *   The key's permitted-usage algorithm is invalid.
        *   The key attributes, as a whole, are invalid.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED
        The implementation does not permit creating a key with the specified attributes due to some implementation-specific policy.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_CORRUPT
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_INVALID

    The shared secret is retrieved as a key.
    Its location, policy, and type are taken from ``attributes``.

    The size of the returned key is always the bit-size of the PAKE shared secret, rounded up to a whole number of bytes. The size of the shared secret is dependent on the PAKE algorithm and cipher suite.

    This is the final call in a PAKE operation, which retrieves the shared secret as a key.
    It is recommended that this key is used as an input to a key-derivation operation to produce additional cryptographic keys.
    For some PAKE algorithms, the shared secret is also suitable for use as a key in cryptographic operations such as encryption.
    Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for more information.

    Depending on the key confirmation requested in the cipher suite, `psa_pake_get_shared_key()` must be called either before or after the key-confirmation output and input steps for the PAKE algorithm.
    The key confirmation affects the guarantees that can be made about the shared key:

    .. list-table::
        :class: borderless
        :widths: 1 4

        *   -   **Unconfirmed key**
            -   If the cipher suite used to set up the operation requested an unconfirmed key, the application must call `psa_pake_get_shared_key()` after the key-exchange output and input steps are completed.
                The PAKE algorithm provides a cryptographic guarantee that only a peer who used the same password, and identity inputs, is able to compute the same key.
                However, there is no guarantee that the peer is the participant it claims to be, and was able to compute the same key.

                Since the peer is not authenticated, no action should be taken that assumes that the peer is who it claims to be.
                For example, do not access restricted resources on the peer's behalf until an explicit authentication has succeeded.

                .. note::
                    Some PAKE algorithms do not enable the output of the shared secret until it has been confirmed.

        *   -   **Confirmed key**
            -   If the cipher suite used to set up the operation requested a confirmed key, the application must call `psa_pake_get_shared_key()` after the key-exchange and key-confirmation output and input steps are completed.

                Following key confirmation, the PAKE algorithm provides a cryptographic guarantee that the peer used the same password and identity inputs, and has computed the identical shared secret key.

                Since the peer is not authenticated, no action should be taken that assumes that the peer is who it claims to be.
                For example, do not access restricted resources on the peer's behalf until an explicit authentication has succeeded.

                .. note::
                    Some PAKE algorithms do not include any key-confirmation steps.

    The exact sequence of calls to perform a password-authenticated key exchange depends on the algorithm in use.
    Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for more information.

    When this function returns successfully, ``operation`` becomes inactive.
    If this function returns an error status, the operation enters an error state and must be aborted by calling `psa_pake_abort()`.

.. function:: psa_pake_abort

    .. summary::
        Abort a PAKE operation.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    .. param:: psa_pake_operation_t * operation
        Initialized PAKE operation.

    .. return:: psa_status_t

        Success.
        The operation object can now be discarded or reused.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The library requires initializing by a call to :code:`psa_crypto_init()`.

    Aborting an operation frees all associated resources except for the ``operation`` object itself.
    Once aborted, the operation object can be reused for another operation by calling `psa_pake_setup()` again.

    This function can be called any time after the operation object has been initialized as described in `psa_pake_operation_t`.

    In particular, calling `psa_pake_abort()` after the operation has been terminated by a call to `psa_pake_abort()` or `psa_pake_get_shared_key()` is safe and has no effect.

.. _pake-jpake:

The J-PAKE protocol
-------------------

J-PAKE is the password-authenticated key exchange by juggling protocol, defined by :RFC-title:`8236`.
This protocol uses the Schnorr Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof (NIZKP), as defined by :RFC-title:`8235`.

J-PAKE is a balanced PAKE, without key confirmation.

.. _jpake-cipher-suites:

J-PAKE cipher suites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When setting up a PAKE cipher suite to use the J-PAKE protocol:

*   Use the :code:`PSA_ALG_JPAKE()` algorithm, parameterized by the required hash algorithm.
*   Use a PAKE primitive for the required elliptic curve, or finite field group.
*   J-PAKE does not confirm the shared secret key that results from the key exchange.

For example, the following code creates a cipher suite to select J-PAKE using P-256 with the SHA-256 hash function:

.. code-block:: xref

    psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite = PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT;

    psa_pake_cs_set_algorithm(&cipher_suite, PSA_ALG_JPAKE(PSA_ALG_SHA_256));
    psa_pake_cs_set_primitive(&cipher_suite,
                              PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE(PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC,
                                                 PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_R1, 256));
    psa_pake_cs_set_key_confirmation(&cipher_suite, PSA_PAKE_UNCONFIRMED_KEY);

More information on selecting a specific elliptic curve or Diffie-Hellman field is provided with the `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC` and `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_DH` constants.

.. _jpake-passwords:

J-PAKE password processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PAKE operation for J-PAKE expects a key of type type :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_PASSWORD` or :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_PASSWORD_HASH`.
The same key value must be provided to the PAKE operation in both participants.

The key can be the password text itself, in an agreed character encoding, or some value derived from the password, as required by a higher level protocol.
For low-entropy passwords, it is recommended that a key-stretching derivation algorithm, such as PBKDF2, is used, and the resulting password hash is used as the key input to the PAKE operation.

.. _jpake-operation:

J-PAKE operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The J-PAKE operation follows the protocol shown in :numref:`fig-jpake`.

.. figure:: /figure/pake/j-pake.*
    :name: fig-jpake

    The J-PAKE protocol

    The variable names :math:`x1`, :math:`g1`, and so on, are taken from the finite field implementation of J-PAKE in :RFC:`8236#2`.

    Details of the computation for the key shares and zero-knowledge proofs are in :RFC:`8236` and :RFC:`8235`.

Setup
^^^^^

J-PAKE does not assign roles to the participants, so it is not necessary to call `psa_pake_set_role()`.

J-PAKE requires both an application and a peer identity.
If the peer identity provided to `psa_pake_set_peer()` does not match the data received from the peer, then the call to `psa_pake_input()` for the `PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF` step will fail with :code:`PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE`.

J-PAKE does not use a context.
A call to `psa_pake_set_context()` for a J-PAKE operation will fail with :code:`PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE`.

The following steps demonstrate the application code for 'User' in :numref:`fig-jpake`. The code flow for the 'Peer' is the same as for 'User', as J-PAKE is a balanced PAKE.

1.  To prepare a J-PAKE operation, initialize and set up a :code:`psa_pake_operation_t` object by calling the following functions:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_pake_operation_t jpake = PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT;

        psa_pake_setup(&jpake, pake_key, &cipher_suite);
        psa_pake_set_user(&jpake, ...);
        psa_pake_set_peer(&jpake, ...);

    See :secref:`jpake-cipher-suites` and :secref:`jpake-passwords` for details on the requirements for the cipher suite and key.

    The key material is used as an array of bytes, which is converted to an integer as described in :cite-title:`SEC1` §2.3.8, before reducing it modulo :math:`q`.
    Here, :math:`q`` is the order of the group defined by the cipher-suite primitive.
    `psa_pake_setup()` will return an error if the result of the conversion and reduction is ``0``.

Key exchange
^^^^^^^^^^^^

After setup, the key exchange flow for J-PAKE is as follows:

2.  Round one.

    The application can either extract the round one output values first, and then provide the round one inputs that are received from the Peer; or provide the peer inputs first, and then extract the outputs.

    *   To get the first round data that needs to be sent to the peer, make the following calls to `psa_pake_output()`, in the order shown:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Get g1
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Get V1, the ZKP public key for x1
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Get r1, the ZKP proof for x1
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);
            // Get g2
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Get V2, the ZKP public key for x2
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Get r2, the ZKP proof for x2
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

    *   To provide the first round data received from the peer to the operation, make the following calls to `psa_pake_input()`, in the order shown:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Set g3
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Set V3, the ZKP public key for x3
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Set r3, the ZKP proof for x3
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);
            // Set g4
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Set V4, the ZKP public key for x4
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Set r4, the ZKP proof for x4
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

#.  Round two.

    The application can either extract the round two output values first, and then provide the round two inputs that are received from the Peer; or provide the peer inputs first, and then extract the outputs.

    *   To get the second round data that needs to be sent to the peer, make the following calls to `psa_pake_output()`, in the order shown:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Get A
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Get V5, the ZKP public key for x2*s
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Get r5, the ZKP proof for x2*s
            psa_pake_output(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

    *   To provide the second round data received from the peer to the operation, make the following calls to `psa_pake_input()`, in the order shown:

        .. code-block:: xref

            // Set B
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
            // Set V6, the ZKP public key for x4*s
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PUBLIC, ...);
            // Set r6, the ZKP proof for x4*s
            psa_pake_input(&jpake, PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF, ...);

#.  To use the shared secret, extract it as a key-derivation key. For example, to extract a derivation key for HKDF-SHA-256:

    .. code-block:: xref

        // Set up the key attributes
        psa_key_attributes_t att = PSA_KEY_ATTRIBUTES_INIT;
        psa_set_key_type(&att, PSA_KEY_TYPE_DERIVE);
        psa_set_key_usage_flags(&att, PSA_KEY_USAGE_DERIVE);
        psa_set_key_algorithm(&att, PSA_ALG_HKDF(PSA_ALG_SHA_256));

        // Get Ka=Kb=K
        psa_key_id_t shared_key;
        psa_pake_get_shared_key(&jpake, &att, &shared_key);

For more information about the format of the values which are passed for each step, see :secref:`pake-steps`.

If the verification of a Zero-knowledge proof provided by the peer fails, then the corresponding call to `psa_pake_input()` for the `PSA_PAKE_STEP_ZK_PROOF` step will return :code:`PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE`.

The shared secret that is produced by J-PAKE is not suitable for use as an encryption key.
It must be used as an input to a key-derivation operation to produce additional cryptographic keys.

.. warning::

    At the end of this sequence there is a cryptographic guarantee that only a peer that used the same password is able to compute the same key.
    But there is no guarantee that the peer is the participant it claims to be, or that the peer used the same password during the exchange.

    At this point, authentication is implicit --- material encrypted or authenticated using the computed key can only be decrypted or verified by someone with the same key.
    The peer is not authenticated at this point, and no action should be taken by the application which assumes that the peer is authenticated, for example, by accessing restricted resources.

    To make the authentication explicit, there are various methods to confirm that both parties have the same key. See :RFC:`8236#5` for two examples.

.. _pake-spake2p:

The SPAKE2+ protocol
--------------------

SPAKE2+ is the augmented password-authenticated key exchange protocol, defined by :rfc-title:`9383`.
SPAKE2+ includes confirmation of the shared secret key that results from the key exchange.

SPAKE2+ is required by :cite-title:`MATTER`, as MATTER_PAKE.
:cite:`MATTER` uses an earlier draft of the SPAKE2+ protocol, :cite-title:`SPAKE2P-2`.

Although the operation of the PAKE is similar for both of these variants, they have different key schedules for the derivation of the shared secret.

.. _spake2p-cipher-suites:

SPAKE2+ cipher suites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SPAKE2+ is instantiated with the following parameters:

*   An elliptic curve group.
*   A cryptographic hash function.
*   A key-derivation function.
*   A keyed MAC function.

Valid combinations of these parameters are defined in the table of cipher suites in :rfc:`9383#4`.

When setting up a PAKE cipher suite to use the SPAKE2+ protocol defined in :rfc:`9383`:

*   For cipher-suites that use HMAC for key confirmation, use the :code:`PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P_HMAC()` algorithm, parameterized by the required hash algorithm.
*   For cipher-suites that use CMAC-AES-128 for key confirmation, use the :code:`PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P_CMAC()` algorithm, parameterized by the required hash algorithm.
*   Use a PAKE primitive for the required elliptic curve.

For example, the following code creates a cipher suite to select SPAKE2+ using edwards25519 with the SHA-256 hash function:

.. code-block:: xref

    psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite = PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT;

    psa_pake_cs_set_algorithm(&cipher_suite, PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P_HMAC(PSA_ALG_SHA_256));
    psa_pake_cs_set_primitive(&cipher_suite,
                              PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE(PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC,
                                                 PSA_ECC_FAMILY_TWISTED_EDWARDS, 255));

When setting up a PAKE cipher suite to use the SPAKE2+ protocol used by :cite:`MATTER`:

*   Use the :code:`PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P_MATTER` algorithm.
*   Use the :code:`PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE(PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC, PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_R1, 256)` PAKE primitive.

The following code creates a cipher suite to select the :cite:`MATTER` variant of SPAKE2+:

.. code-block:: xref

    psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite = PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT;

    psa_pake_cs_set_algorithm(&cipher_suite, PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P_MATTER);
    psa_pake_cs_set_primitive(&cipher_suite,
                              PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE(PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC,
                                                 PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_R1, 256));

.. _spake2p-registration:

SPAKE2+ registration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SPAKE2+ protocol has distinct roles for the two participants:

*   The *Prover* takes the role of client.
    It uses the protocol to prove that it knows the secret password, and produce a shared secret.
*   The *Verifier* takes the role of server.
    It uses the protocol to verify the client's proof, and produce a shared secret.

The registration phase of SPAKE2+ provides the initial password processing, described in :rfc:`9383#3.2`.
The result of registration is two pairs of values --- :math:`(w0, w1)` and :math:`(w0, L)` --- that need to be provided during the authentication phase to the Prover and Verifier, respectively.
The design of SPAKE2+ ensures that knowledge of :math:`(w0, L)` does not enable an attacker to determine the password, or to compute :math:`w1`.

In the |API|, the registration output values are managed as an asymmetric key pair:

*   The Prover values, :math:`(w0, w1)`, are stored in a key of type `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_KEY_PAIR()`.
*   The Verifier values, :math:`(w0, L)`, are stored in a key of type `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_PUBLIC_KEY()`, or derived from the matching `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_KEY_PAIR()`.

The SPAKE2+ key types are parameterized by the same elliptic curve as the SPAKE2+ cipher suite.

The key pair is derived from the initial SPAKE2+ password prior to starting the PAKE operation.
It is recommended to use a key-stretching derivation algorithm, for example PBKDF2.
This process can take place immediately before the PAKE operation, or derived at some earlier point and stored by the participant.
Alternatively, the Verifier can be provisioned with the `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_PUBLIC_KEY()` for the protocol, by the Prover, or some other agent.
:numref:`fig-spake2p-reg` illustrates some example SPAKE2+ key-derivation flows.

The resulting SPAKE2+ key pair must be protected at least as well as the password.
The public key, exported from the key pair, does not need to be kept confidential.
It is recommended that the Verifier stores only the public key, because disclosure of the public key does not enable an attacker to impersonate the Prover.

    Examples of SPAKE2+ key-derivation procedures

    The variable names :math:`w0`, :math:`w1`, and :math:`L` are taken from the description of SPAKE2+ in :RFC:`9383`.

    Details of the computation for the key-derivation values are in :RFC:`9383#3.2`.

The following steps demonstrate the derivation of a SPAKE2+ key pair using PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256, for use with a SPAKE2+ cipher suite, ``cipher_suite``. See :secref:`spake2p-cipher-suites` for an example of how to construct the cipher suite object.

1.  Allocate and initialize a key-derivation object:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_key_derivation_operation_t pbkdf = PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_OPERATION_INIT;

#.  Setup the key derivation from the SPAKE2+ password, ``password_key``, and parameters ``pbkdf2_params``:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_key_derivation_setup(&pbkdf, PSA_ALG_PBKDF2_HMAC(PSA_ALG_SHA_256));
        psa_key_derivation_input_key(&pbkdf, PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_INPUT_PASSWORD, password_key);
        psa_key_derivation_input_integer(&pbkdf, PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_INPUT_COST, pbkdf2_params.cost);
        psa_key_derivation_input_bytes(&pbkdf, PSA_KEY_DERIVATION_INPUT_SALT,
                                               &pbkdf2_params.salt, pbkdf2_params.salt_len);

#.  Allocate and initialize a key attributes object:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_key_attributes_t att = PSA_KEY_ATTRIBUTES_INIT;

#.  Set the key type, size, and policy from the ``cipher_suite`` object:

    .. code-block:: xref

.. _spake2p-operation:

SPAKE2+ operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SPAKE2+ operation follows the protocol shown in :numref:`fig-spake2p`.

.. figure:: /figure/pake/spake2plus.*
    :name: fig-spake2p

    The SPAKE2+ authentication and key confirmation protocol

    The variable names :math:`w0`, :math:`w1`, :math:`L`, and so on, are taken from the description of SPAKE2+ in :RFC:`9383`.

    Details of the computation for the key shares is in :RFC:`9383#3.3` and confirmation values in :RFC:`9383#3.4`.

Setup
^^^^^

In SPAKE2+, the Prover uses the `PSA_PAKE_ROLE_CLIENT` role, and the Verifier uses the `PSA_PAKE_ROLE_SERVER` role.

The key passed to the Prover must be a SPAKE2+ key pair, which is derived as recommended in :secref:`spake2p-registration`.
The key passed to the Verifier can either be a SPAKE2+ key pair, or a SPAKE2+ public key.
A SPAKE2+ public key is imported from data that is output by calling :code:`psa_export_public_key()` on a SPAKE2+ key pair.

Both participants in SPAKE2+ have an optional identity.
If no identity value is provided, then a zero-length string is used for that identity in the protocol.
If the participants do not supply the same identity values to the protocol, the computed secrets will be different, and key confirmation will fail.

Participants in SPAKE2+ can optionally provide a context:

*   If `psa_pake_set_context()` is called, then the context and its encoded length are included in the SPAKE2+ transcript computation.
    This includes the case of a zero-length context.
*   If `psa_pake_set_context()` is not called, then the context and its encoded length are omitted entirely from the SPAKE2+ transcript computation.
    See :RFC:`9383#3.3`.

If the participants do not supply the same context value to the protocol, the computed secrets will be different, and key confirmation will fail.

The following steps demonstrate the application code for both Prover and Verifier in :numref:`fig-spake2p`.

**Prover**
    To prepare a SPAKE2+ operation for the Prover, initialize and set up a :code:`psa_pake_operation_t` object by calling the following functions:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_pake_operation_t spake2p_p = PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT;

        psa_pake_setup(&spake2p_p, pake_key_p, &cipher_suite);
        psa_pake_set_role(&spake2p_p, PSA_PAKE_ROLE_CLIENT);

    The key ``pake_key_p`` is a SPAKE2+ key pair, `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_KEY_PAIR()`.
    See :secref:`spake2p-cipher-suites` for details on constructing a suitable cipher suite.

**Prover**
    Provide any additional, optional, parameters:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_pake_set_user(&spake2p_p, ...);       // Prover identity
        psa_pake_set_peer(&spake2p_p, ...);       // Verifier identity
        psa_pake_set_context(&spake2p_p, ...);    // Optional context

**Verifier**
    To prepare a SPAKE2+ operation for the Verifier, initialize and set up a :code:`psa_pake_operation_t` object by calling the following functions:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_pake_operation_t spake2p_v = PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT;

        psa_pake_setup(&spake2p_v, pake_key_v, &cipher_suite);
        psa_pake_set_role(&spake2p_v, PSA_PAKE_ROLE_SERVER);

    The key ``pake_key_v`` is a SPAKE2+ key pair, `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_KEY_PAIR()`, or public key, `PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_PUBLIC_KEY()`.
    See :secref:`spake2p-cipher-suites` for details on constructing a suitable cipher suite.

**Verifier**
    Provide any additional, optional, parameters:

    .. code-block:: xref

        psa_pake_set_user(&spake2p_v, ...);       // Verifier identity
        psa_pake_set_peer(&spake2p_v, ...);       // Prover identity
        psa_pake_set_context(&spake2p_v, ...);    // Optional context

Key exchange
^^^^^^^^^^^^

After setup, the key exchange and confirmation flow for SPAKE2+ is as follows.

.. note::

    The sequence of calls for the Prover, and the sequence for the Verifier, must be in exactly this order.

**Prover**
    To get the key share to send to the Verifier, call:

    .. code-block:: xref

        // Get shareP
        psa_pake_output(&spake2p_p, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);

**Verifier**
    To provide and validate the key share received from the Prover, call:

    .. code-block:: xref

        // Set shareP
        psa_pake_input(&spake2p_v, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);

**Verifier**
    To get the Verifier key share and confirmation value to send to the Prover, call:

    .. code-block:: xref

        // Get shareV
        psa_pake_output(&spake2p_v, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
        // Get confirmV
        psa_pake_output(&spake2p_v, PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM, ...);

**Prover**
    To provide and validate the key share and verify the confirmation value received from the Verifier, call:

    .. code-block:: xref

        // Set shareV
        psa_pake_input(&spake2p_p, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
        // Set confirmV
        psa_pake_input(&spake2p_p, PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_CONFIRM, ...);

**Prover**
    To get the Prover key confirmation value to send to the Verifier, call:

    .. code-block:: xref

        // Get confirmP
        psa_pake_output(&spake2p_p, PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM, ...);

**Verifier**
    To verify the confirmation value received from the Prover, call:

    .. code-block:: xref

        // Set confirmP
        psa_pake_input(&spake2p_v, PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM, ...);

**Prover**
    To use the shared secret, extract it as a key-derivation key.
    For example, to extract a derivation key for HKDF-SHA-256:

    .. code-block:: xref

        // Set up the key attributes
        psa_key_attributes_t att = PSA_KEY_ATTRIBUTES_INIT;
        psa_set_key_type(&att, PSA_KEY_TYPE_DERIVE);
        psa_set_key_usage_flags(&att, PSA_KEY_USAGE_DERIVE);
        psa_set_key_algorithm(&att, PSA_ALG_HKDF(PSA_ALG_SHA_256));

        // Get K_shared
        psa_key_id_t shared_key;
        psa_pake_get_shared_key(&spake2p_p, &att, &shared_key);

**Verifier**
    To use the shared secret, extract it as a key-derivation key.
    The same key attributes can be used as the Prover:

    .. code-block:: xref

        // Get K_shared
        psa_key_id_t shared_key;
        psa_pake_get_shared_key(&spake2p_v, &att, &shared_key);

The shared secret that is produced by SPAKE2+ is pseudorandom.
Although it can be used directly as an encryption key, it is recommended to use the shared secret as an input to a key-derivation operation to produce additional cryptographic keys.

For more information about the format of the values which are passed for each step, see :secref:`pake-steps`.

If the validation of a key share fails, then the corresponding call to `psa_pake_input()` for the `PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE` step will return :code:`PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT`.
If the verification of a key confirmation value fails, then the corresponding call to `psa_pake_input()` for the `PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM` step will return :code:`PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE`.

        The SPAKE2+ algorithm, as used by the Matter v1 specification.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    This is the PAKE algorithm specified as MATTER_PAKE in :cite-title:`MATTER`.
    This is based on draft-02 of the SPAKE2+ protocol, :cite-title:`SPAKE2P-2`.
    :cite:`MATTER` specifies a single SPAKE2+ cipher suite, P256-SHA256-HKDF-HMAC-SHA256.

    The shared secret that is produced by this operation must be processed as directed by the :cite:`MATTER` specification.

    This algorithm uses the same SPAKE2+ key types, key derivation, protocol flow, and the API usage described in :secref:`pake-spake2p`.
    However, the following aspects are different:

    *   The key schedule is different.
        This affects the computation of the shared secret and key confirmation values.
    *   The protocol inputs and outputs have been renamed between draft-02 and the final RFC, as follows:
