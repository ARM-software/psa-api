Asymmetric signature
====================

An asymmetric signature algorithm provides two functions:

*   **Sign**: Calculate a message signature using a private, or secret, key.
*   **Verify**: Check that a signature matches a message using a public key.

Successful verification indicates that the message signature was calculated using the private key that is associated with the public key.

In the |API|, an asymmetric-sign function requires an asymmetric key pair; and an asymmetric-verify function requires an asymmetric public key or key pair.

.. rubric:: Signature schemes

The |API| supports the following signature schemes:

*   :secref:`rsa-sign-algorithms`
*   :secref:`ecdsa-sign-algorithms`
*   :secref:`eddsa-sign-algorithms`
*   :secref:`slh-dsa-algorithms`
*   :secref:`ml-dsa-algorithms`
*   :secref:`lms-algorithms`
*   :secref:`xmss-algorithms`

.. rubric:: Types of signature algorithm

There are three categories of asymmetric signature algorithm in the |API|:

*   Hash-and-sign algorithms, that have two distinct phases:

    -   Calculate a hash of the message
    -   Calculate a signature over the hash

    For these algorithms, the asymmetric signature API allows applications to either calculate the full message signature, or calculate the signature of a pre-computed hash. For example, this enables the application to use a multi-part hash operation to calculate the hash of a large message, prior to calculating or verifying a signature on the calculated hash.

    The following algorithms are in this category:

    | `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN`
    | `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS`
    | `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS_ANY_SALT`
    | `PSA_ALG_ECDSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_ED25519PH`
    | `PSA_ALG_ED448PH`
    | `PSA_ALG_HASH_SLH_DSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_HASH_SLH_DSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_HASH_ML_DSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_HASH_ML_DSA`

*   Message signature algorithms that do not separate the message processing from the signature calculations. This approach can provide better security against certain types of attack.

    For these algorithms, it is not possible to inject a pre-computed hash into the middle of the algorithm. An application can choose to calculate a message hash, and sign that instead of the message --- but this is not functionally equivalent to signing the message, and eliminates the security benefits of signing the message directly.

    Some of these algorithms still permit the signature of a large message to be calculated, or verified, by providing the message data in fragments. This is possible when the algorithm only processes the message data once. See the individual algorithm descriptions for details.

    The following algorithms are in this category:

    | `PSA_ALG_PURE_EDDSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_EDDSA_CTX`
    | `PSA_ALG_SLH_DSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_SLH_DSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_ML_DSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ML_DSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_LMS`
    | `PSA_ALG_HSS`
    | `PSA_ALG_XMSS`
    | `PSA_ALG_XMSS_MT`

*   Specialized signature algorithms, that use part of a standard signature algorithm within a specific protocol. It is recommended that these algorithms are only used for that purpose, with inputs as specified by the higher-level protocol. See the individual algorithm descriptions for details on their usage.

    The following algorithms are in this category:

    | `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN_RAW`
    | `PSA_ALG_ECDSA_ANY`

.. rubric:: Signature functions

The |API| provides several functions for calculating and verifying signatures:

*   The single-part signature and verification functions, `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_verify_message()`, take a message as one of their inputs, and perform the sign or verify algorithm.

    These functions can be used on any hash-and-sign, or message signature, algorithms. See also `PSA_ALG_IS_SIGN_MESSAGE()`.

*   The single-part functions, `psa_sign_hash()` and `psa_verify_hash()`, typically take a message hash as one of their inputs, and perform the sign or verify algorithm.

    These functions can be used on any hash-and-sign signature algorithm. It is recommended that the input to these functions is a hash, computed using the corresponding hash algorithm. To determine which hash algorithm to use, the macro `PSA_ALG_GET_HASH()` can be called on the signature algorithm identifier.

    These functions can also be used on the specialized signature algorithms, with a hash or encoded-hash as input. See also `PSA_ALG_IS_SIGN_HASH()`.

*   Many modern signature algorithms have been designed to also accept a context parameter to provide domain separation.
    Version 1.4 of the |API| introduced four new functions that accept contexts: `psa_sign_message_with_context()`, `psa_sign_hash_with_context()`, `psa_verify_message_with_context()`, and `psa_verify_hash_with_context()`.

    If called with a zero-length context, these functions produce the same signature as the associated function without a context parameter.

    .. note::

        If a signature scheme treats the absence of a context parameter differently to a zero-length context, the |API| defines distinct algorithm identifiers for the two variants.
        For example, when using a 255-bit key with EdDSA, `PSA_ALG_PURE_EDDSA` implements Ed25519 (without a context) and `PSA_ALG_EDDSA_CTX` implements Ed25519ctx (with a context, which can be zero-length).
        See :secref:`eddsa-sign-algorithms`.

    It is an error to provide a non-zero-length context with an algorithm that does not accept contexts.

    Code written to be cryptographically agile can use the new functions, provided it guards against providing a non-zero-length context with an algorithm that does not support them.

    The `PSA_ALG_SIGN_SUPPORTS_CONTEXT()` macro can be used to determine if the implementation of an algorithm supports the use of non-zero-length contexts.

See :secref:`single-part-signature`.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        The RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 message signature scheme, with hashing.

    .. param:: hash_alg
        A hash algorithm: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_HASH(hash_alg)` is true. This includes `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH` when specifying the algorithm in a key policy.

    .. return::
        The corresponding RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature algorithm.

        Unspecified if ``hash_alg`` is not a supported hash algorithm.

    This hash-and-sign signature algorithm can be used with both the message and hash signature functions.
    RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 does not have a context parameter.
    However, the sign or verify with context functions can be used with a zero-length context.

    This signature scheme is defined by :RFC-title:`8017#8.2` under the name RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5.

    When used with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()`, the provided ``hash`` parameter is used as :math:`H` from step 2 onwards in the message encoding algorithm ``EMSA-PKCS1-V1_5-ENCODE()`` in :RFC:`8017#9.2`. :math:`H` is the message digest, computed using the ``hash_alg`` hash algorithm.

    :numref:`tab-rsa-pkcs1v15-oid` lists the OID to use when formatting the hash.
    Note that the DER-encoded OID in the table is just the data value, without the OID tag and length.

    .. admonition:: Implementation note

        The current version of this specification does not specify the behavior of `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN` with hash algorithms that lack a standard OID, namely:

        *   `PSA_ALG_AES_MMO_ZIGBEE`
        *   `PSA_ALG_ASCON_HASH256`
        *   `PSA_ALG_SHAKE256_512`

        It is recommended that these hash algorithms are not supported with `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN`.
        Future versions of the |API| might specify what OID to use.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN_RAW
    :definition: ((psa_algorithm_t) 0x06000200)

    .. summary::
        The raw RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature algorithm, without hashing.

    This specialized signature algorithm can only be used with the `psa_sign_hash()` and `psa_verify_hash()` functions.
    RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 does not have a context parameter.
    However, `psa_sign_hash_with_context()` or `psa_verify_hash_with_context()` can be used with a zero-length context.

    This signature scheme is defined by :RFC-title:`8017#8.2` under the name RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5.

    The ``hash`` parameter to `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()` is used as :math:`T` from step 3 onwards in the message encoding algorithm ``EMSA-PKCS1-V1_5-ENCODE()`` in :RFC:`8017#9.2`. :math:`T` is normally the DER encoding of the *DigestInfo* structure produced by step 2 in the message encoding algorithm, but it can be any byte string within the available length.

    The wildcard key policy :code:`PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN(PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH)` also permits a key to be used with the `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN_RAW` signature algorithm.

    .. rationale::

        RSA keys that are used for TLS session establishment can be used in different versions of the TLS protocol.

        *   Versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the TLS protocol uses the `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN_RAW` algorithm, which signs an encoded SHA-1 + MD5 hash.
        *   Version 1.2 of the TLS protocol uses the :code:`PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN(PSA_ALG_SHA_256))` algorithm, which signs the [unencoded] SHA-256 hash.

    .. summary::
        The RSA PSS message signature scheme, with hashing.

    .. param:: hash_alg
        A hash algorithm: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_HASH(hash_alg)` is true. This includes `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH` when specifying the algorithm in a key policy.

    .. return::
        The corresponding RSA PSS signature algorithm.

        Unspecified if ``hash_alg`` is not a supported hash algorithm.

    This hash-and-sign signature algorithm can be used with both the message and hash signature functions.
    RSA PSS does not have a context parameter.
    However, the sign or verify with context functions can be used with a zero-length context.

    This algorithm is randomized: each invocation returns a different, equally valid signature.

    This is the signature scheme defined by :RFC:`8017#8.1` under the name RSASSA-PSS, with the following options:

    *   The mask generation function is *MGF1* defined by :RFC:`8017#B`.
    *   When creating a signature, the salt length is equal to the length of the hash, or the largest possible salt length for the algorithm and key size if that is smaller than the hash length.
    *   When verifying a signature, the salt length must be equal to the length of the hash, or the largest possible salt length for the algorithm and key size if that is smaller than the hash length.
    *   The specified hash algorithm, ``hash_alg``,  is used to hash the input message, to create the salted hash, and for the mask generation.

    When used with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()`, the provided ``hash`` parameter is the message digest, computed using the ``hash_alg`` hash algorithm.

    .. note::

        The `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS_ANY_SALT()` algorithm is equivalent to `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS()` when creating a signature, but permits any salt length when verifying a signature.

        The corresponding RSA PSS signature algorithm.

        Unspecified if ``hash_alg`` is not a supported hash algorithm.

    This hash-and-sign signature algorithm can be used with both the message and hash signature functions.
    RSA PSS does not have a context parameter.

    *   When verifying a signature, any salt length permitted by the RSASSA-PSS signature algorithm is accepted.
    *   The specified hash algorithm, ``hash_alg``,  is used to hash the input message, to create the salted hash, and for the mask generation.

    When used with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()`, the provided ``hash`` parameter is the message digest, computed using the ``hash_alg`` hash algorithm.

    .. note::

        The `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS()` algorithm is equivalent to `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS_ANY_SALT()` when creating a signature, but is strict about the permitted salt length when verifying a signature.

ECDSA signature algorithms
--------------------------

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_ECDSA
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        The randomized ECDSA signature scheme, with hashing.

    .. param:: hash_alg
        A hash algorithm: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_HASH(hash_alg)` is true. This includes `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH` when specifying the algorithm in a key policy.

    .. return::
        The corresponding randomized ECDSA signature algorithm.

        Unspecified if ``hash_alg`` is not a supported hash algorithm.

    This hash-and-sign signature algorithm can be used with both the message and hash signature functions.
    ECDSA does not have a context parameter.
    However, the sign or verify with context functions can be used with a zero-length context.

    When used with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()`, the provided ``hash`` parameter is the message digest, computed using the ``hash_alg`` hash algorithm.

    This algorithm is randomized: each invocation returns a different, equally valid signature.

    The ECDSA signature scheme is defined by :cite-title:`SEC1`, and also by :cite-title:`X9-62`, with a random per-message secret number :math:`k`.

    The representation of the signature as a byte string consists of the concatenation of the signature values :math:`r` and :math:`s`.
    Each of :math:`r` and :math:`s` is encoded as a big-endian :math:`m`-octet string, where :math:`m` is the integer for which :math:`2^{8(m-1)} \leq q < 2^{8m}`, and :math:`q` is the order of the elliptic curve.

    When based on the same hash algorithm, the verification operations for `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` and `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA` are identical. A signature created using `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` can be verified with the same key using either `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` or `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA`. Similarly, a signature created using `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA` can be verified with the same key using either `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` or `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA`.

    .. note::

        A verifier cannot determine whether a signature was produced with deterministic ECDSA or with randomized ECDSA: it is only possible to verify that a signature was made with ECDSA with the private key corresponding to the public key used for the verification.

    When :code:`PSA_ALG_ECDSA(hash_alg)` is used as a permitted algorithm in a key policy, this permits:

    *   :code:`PSA_ALG_ECDSA(hash_alg)` as the algorithm in a call to any signing function.
    *   :code:`PSA_ALG_ECDSA(hash_alg)` or :code:`PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA(hash_alg)` as the algorithm in a call to any signature verification function.

        The randomized ECDSA signature scheme, without hashing.

    This specialized signature algorithm can only be used with the `psa_sign_hash()` and `psa_verify_hash()` functions.
    ECDSA does not have a context parameter.
    However, `psa_sign_hash_with_context()` or `psa_verify_hash_with_context()` can be used with a zero-length context.

    This is the same signature scheme as `PSA_ALG_ECDSA`, but without specifying a hash algorithm, and skipping the message hashing operation.

    .. warning::

        This algorithm is only recommended to sign or verify a sequence of bytes that are a pre-computed hash. Note that the input is padded with zeros on the left or truncated on the right as required to fit the curve size.

    This algorithm cannot be used with the wildcard key policy :code:`PSA_ALG_ECDSA(PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH)`. It is only permitted when `PSA_ALG_ECDSA_ANY` is the key's permitted-algorithm policy.

        A hash algorithm: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_HASH(hash_alg)` is true. This includes `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH` when specifying the algorithm in a key policy.

    .. return::
        The corresponding deterministic ECDSA signature algorithm.

        Unspecified if ``hash_alg`` is not a supported hash algorithm.

    This hash-and-sign signature algorithm can be used with both the message and hash signature functions.
    ECDSA does not have a context parameter.
    However, the sign or verify with context functions can be used with a zero-length context.

    When used with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()`, the provided ``hash`` parameter is the message digest, computed using the ``hash_alg`` hash algorithm.

    This is the deterministic ECDSA signature scheme defined by :RFC-title:`6979`.

    The representation of a signature is the same as with `PSA_ALG_ECDSA`.

    When based on the same hash algorithm, the verification operations for `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` and `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA` are identical. A signature created using `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` can be verified with the same key using either `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` or `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA`. Similarly, a signature created using `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA` can be verified with the same key using either `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` or `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA`.

    .. admonition:: Implementation note

        The current version of this specification does not specify the behavior of `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA` with hash algorithms that are not listed in :numref:`tab-hmac-hash`.
        It is recommended that these hash algorithms are not supported with `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA`, as discussed in the specification of `PSA_ALG_HMAC`.

    .. note::

        A verifier cannot determine whether a signature was produced with deterministic ECDSA or with randomized ECDSA: it is only possible to verify that a signature was made with ECDSA with the private key corresponding to the public key used for the verification.

    When :code:`PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA(hash_alg)` is used as a permitted algorithm in a key policy, this permits:

    *   :code:`PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA(hash_alg)` as the algorithm in a call to any signing function.
    *   :code:`PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA(hash_alg)` or :code:`PSA_ALG_ECDSA(hash_alg)` as the algorithm in a call to any signature verification function.

EdDSA signature algorithms
--------------------------

The PureEdDSA and HashEdDSA digital signature algorithms are defined by :RFC-title:`8032`.
They are used with the Edwards25519 and Edwards448 elliptic curve keys, see `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_TWISTED_EDWARDS`.

*   PureEdDSA is a set of message-signing algorithms, that cannot be split into a hash step, followed by a signature or verification step.

*   HashEdDSA is a pair of hash-and-sign algorithms, with a specified hash algorithm associated with each key size.

Both PureEdDSA and HashEdDSA can be used with contexts, which enables domain-separation when signatures are made of different message structures with the same key.
For EdDSA, the context is an arbitrary byte string between zero and 255 bytes in length.

The development of EdDSA resulted in a total of five distinct algorithms:

*   Ed25519: the original PureEdDSA algorithm for the Edwards25519 curve, which does not accept a context.
*   Ed25519ctx: a second PureEdDSA algorithm for the Edwards25519 curve, with a context parameter.
*   Ed448: the PureEdDSA algorithm for the Edwards448 curve, with a context parameter.
*   Ed25519ph: the HashEdDSA algorithm for the Edwards25519 curve, with a context parameter.
*   Ed448ph: the HashEdDSA algorithm for the Edwards448 curve, with a context parameter.

:numref:`table-eddsa-algs` shows the algorithm identifiers in the |API|, and how they are used to select the appropriate EdDSA algorithm.

    With a zero-length context, `PSA_ALG_PURE_EDDSA` can also be used with the `psa_sign_message_with_context()` and `psa_verify_message_with_context()` functions.
    It cannot be used to sign hashes.

    This is the PureEdDSA digital signature algorithm defined by :RFC-title:`8032`, with zero-length context.

    PureEdDSA requires an elliptic curve key on a twisted Edwards curve (see `PSA_ECC_FAMILY_TWISTED_EDWARDS`).
    The following curves are supported:

    *   Edwards25519: the Ed25519 algorithm is computed.
        The output signature is a 64-byte string: the concatenation of :math:`R` and :math:`S` as defined by :RFC:`8032#5.1.6`.

    *   Edwards448: the Ed448 algorithm is computed, with a zero-length context.
        The output signature is a 114-byte string: the concatenation of :math:`R` and :math:`S` as defined by :RFC:`8032#5.2.6`.

    .. note::
        To sign or verify the pre-computed hash of a message using EdDSA, the HashEdDSA algorithms (`PSA_ALG_ED25519PH` and `PSA_ALG_ED448PH`) can be used.
        The signature produced by HashEdDSA is distinct from that produced by PureEdDSA.

    .. note::
        To sign or verify a message with a non-zero-length context using PureEdDSA, use the `PSA_ALG_EDDSA_CTX` algorithm.

.. _slh-dsa-algorithms:

Stateless Hash-based signature algorithms
-----------------------------------------

The SLH-DSA signature and verification scheme is defined in :cite-title:`FIPS205`.
SLH-DSA has twelve parameter sets which provide differing security strengths, trade-off between signature size and computation cost, and selection between SHA2 and SHAKE-based hashing.

SLH-DSA keys are fairly compact, 32, 48, or 64 bytes for the public key, and double that for the key pair.
SLH-DSA signatures are much larger than those for RSA and Elliptic curve schemes, between 7.8kB and 49kB depending on the selected parameter set.
An SLH-DSA signature has the structure described in `[FIPS205]` §9.2, Figure 17.

See `[FIPS205]` §11 for details on the parameter sets, and the public key and generated signature sizes.

The generation of an SLH-DSA key depends on the full parameter specification.
The encoding of each parameter set into the key attributes is described in :secref:`slh-dsa-keys`.

`[FIPS205]` defines pure and pre-hashed variants of the signature scheme, which can either be hedged (randomized) or deterministic.
Four algorithms are defined to support these variants: `PSA_ALG_SLH_DSA`, `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_SLH_DSA`, `PSA_ALG_HASH_SLH_DSA()`, and `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_HASH_SLH_DSA()`.

.. _slh-dsa-deterministic-signatures:

.. rubric:: Hedged and deterministic signatures

Hedging incorporates fresh randomness in the signature computation, resulting in distinct signatures on every signing operation when given identical inputs.
Deterministic signatures do not require additional random data, and result in an identical signature for the same inputs.

Signature verification does not distinguish between a hedged and a deterministic signature.
Either hedged or deterministic algorithms can be used when verifying a signature.

When computing a signature, the key's permitted-algorithm policy must match the requested algorithm, treating hedged and deterministic versions as distinct.
When verifying a signature, the hedged and deterministic versions of each algorithm are considered equivalent when checking the key's permitted-algorithm policy.

.. note::

    The hedged version provides message secrecy and some protection against side-channels.
    `[FIPS205]` recommends that users should use the hedged version if either of these issues are a concern.
    The deterministic variant should only be used if the implementation does not include any source of randomness.

.. admonition:: Implementation note

    `[FIPS205]` recommends that implementations use an approved random number generator to provide the random value in the hedged version.
    However, it notes that use of the hedged variant with a weak RNG is generally preferable to the deterministic variant.

.. rationale::

    The use of fresh randomness, or not, when computing a signature seems like an implementation decision based on the capability of the system, and its vulnerability to specific threats, following the recommendations in `[FIPS205]`.

    However, the |API| gives distinct algorithm identifiers for the hedged and deterministic variants for the following reasons:

    *   `[FIPS205]` §9.1 recommends that SLH-DSA signing keys are only used to compute either deterministic, or hedged, signatures, but not both.
        Supporting this recommendation requires separate algorithm identifiers, and requiring an exact policy match for signature computation.
    *   Enable an application use case to require a specific variant.

.. rubric:: Pure and pre-hashed algorithms

The pre-hashed signature computation *HashSLH-DSA* generates distinct signatures to a pure signature *SLH-DSA*, with the same key and message hashing algorithm.

An SLH-DSA signature can only be verified with an SLH-DSA algorithm.
A HashSLH-DSA signature can only be verified with a HashSLH-DSA algorithm.

:numref:`tab-slh-dsa-oid` lists the hash algorithm OIDs to use with the HashSLH-DSA algorithm.

.. _ml-dsa-algorithms:

Module Lattice-based signature algorithms
-----------------------------------------

The ML-DSA signature and verification scheme is defined in :cite-title:`FIPS204`.
ML-DSA has three parameter sets which provide differing security strengths.

ML-DSA keys are large: 1.2--2.5kB for the public key, and triple that for the key pair.
ML-DSA signatures are much larger than those for RSA and Elliptic curve schemes, between 2.4kB and 4.6kB, depending on the selected parameter set.

See `[FIPS204]` §4 for details on the parameter sets, and the key and generated signature sizes.

The generation of an ML-DSA key depends on the full parameter specification.
The encoding of each parameter set into the key attributes is described in :secref:`ml-dsa-keys`.

`[FIPS204]` defines pure and pre-hashed variants of the signature scheme, which can either be hedged (randomized) or deterministic.
Four algorithms are defined to support these variants: `PSA_ALG_ML_DSA`, `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ML_DSA`, `PSA_ALG_HASH_ML_DSA()`, and `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_HASH_ML_DSA()`.

.. _ml-dsa-deterministic-signatures:

.. rubric:: Hedged and deterministic signatures

Hedging incorporates fresh randomness in the signature computation, resulting in distinct signatures on every signing operation when given identical inputs.
Deterministic signatures do not require additional random data, and result in an identical signature for the same inputs.

Signature verification does not distinguish between a hedged and a deterministic signature.
Either hedged or deterministic algorithms can be used when verifying a signature.

When computing a signature, the key's permitted-algorithm policy must match the requested algorithm, treating hedged and deterministic versions as distinct.
When verifying a signature, the hedged and deterministic versions of each algorithm are considered equivalent when checking the key's permitted-algorithm policy.

.. note::

    The hedged version provides message secrecy and some protection against side-channels.
    `[FIPS204]` recommends that users should use the hedged version if either of these issues are a concern.
    The deterministic variant should only be used if the implementation does not include any source of randomness.

.. admonition:: Implementation note

    `[FIPS204]` recommends that implementations use an approved random number generator to provide the random value in the hedged version.
    However, it notes that use of the hedged variant with a weak RNG is generally preferable to the deterministic variant.

.. rationale::

    The use of fresh randomness, or not, when computing a signature seems like an implementation decision based on the capability of the system, and its vulnerability to specific threats, following the recommendations in `[FIPS204]`.

    However, the |API| gives distinct algorithm identifiers for the hedged and deterministic variants, to enable an application use case to require a specific variant.

.. rubric:: Pure and pre-hashed algorithms

The pre-hashed signature computation *HashML-DSA* generates distinct signatures to a pure signature *ML-DSA*, with the same key and message hashing algorithm.

An ML-DSA signature can only be verified with an ML-DSA algorithm.
A HashML-DSA signature can only be verified with a HashML-DSA algorithm.

All ML-DSA algorithms can be used with contexts, which enables domain-separation when signatures are made of different message structures with the same key.
Context values are arbitrary strings between zero and 255 bytes in length.

*   The signature functions without a context parameter provide a zero-length context when computing or verifying ML-DSA signatures.

The Leighton-Micali Signatures (LMS) and multi-level Hierarchical Signature Scheme (HSS) schemes are defined in :rfc-title:`8554`.

For the |API| to support signature verification, it is only necessary to define a public keys for these schemes, and the default public key formats for import and export.

Support macros

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_IS_SIGN_MESSAGE

        An algorithm identifier: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t`.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` is a signature algorithm that can be used to sign a message. ``0`` if ``alg`` is a signature algorithm that can only be used to sign a pre-computed hash. ``0`` if ``alg`` is not a signature algorithm. This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported algorithm identifier.

    This macro evaluates to ``1`` for hash-and-sign and message-signature algorithms.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_IS_SIGN_HASH
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether the specified algorithm is a signature algorithm that can be used with `psa_sign_hash()` and `psa_verify_hash()`.

    .. param:: alg
        An algorithm identifier: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t`.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` is a signature algorithm that can be used to sign a hash. ``0`` if ``alg`` is a signature algorithm that can only be used to sign a message. ``0`` if ``alg`` is not a signature algorithm. This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported algorithm identifier.

    This macro evaluates to ``1`` for hash-and-sign and specialized signature algorithms.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_IS_HASH_AND_SIGN
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether the specified algorithm is a hash-and-sign algorithm that signs exactly the hash value.

    .. param:: alg
        An algorithm identifier: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t`.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` is a hash-and-sign algorithm that signs exactly the hash value, ``0`` otherwise. This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported algorithm identifier.

        A wildcard signature algorithm policy, using `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH`, returns the same value as the signature algorithm parameterized with a valid hash algorithm.

    This macro identifies algorithms that can be used with `psa_sign_hash()` that use the exact message hash value as an input the signature operation. For example, if :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_HASH_AND_SIGN(alg)` is true, the following call sequence is equivalent to :code:`psa_sign_message(key, alg, msg, msg_len, ...)`:

    .. code-block:: xref

        uint8_t hash[PSA_HASH_MAX_SIZE];
        size_t hash_len;
        psa_hash_compute(PSA_ALG_GET_HASH(alg), msg, msg_len,
                         hash, sizeof(hash), &hash_len);
        psa_sign_hash(key, alg, hash, hash_len, ...);

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_SIGN_SUPPORTS_CONTEXT
    :definition: /* implementation-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether the specified signature algorithm can be used with a non-zero-length context.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4

    .. param:: alg
        A signature algorithm identifier: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_SIGN(alg)` is true.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` is a signature algorithm that can be used with a non-zero-length context.
        ``0`` if ``alg`` is a signature algorithm that cannot be used with a non-zero-length context.
        This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported signature algorithm identifier.

        A wildcard signature algorithm policy, using `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH`, returns the same value as the signature algorithm parameterized with a valid hash algorithm.

    This macro identifies signature algorithms that have a context parameter, and can be used with the appropriate functions that support non-zero-length contexts.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH
    :definition: ((psa_algorithm_t)0x020000ff)

    .. summary::
        When setting a hash-and-sign algorithm in a key policy, permit any hash algorithm.

    This value can be used to form the permitted-algorithm attribute of a key policy for a signature algorithm that is parametrized by a hash. A key with this policy can then be used to perform operations using the same signature algorithm parametrized with any supported hash.
    A signature algorithm created using this macro is a wildcard algorithm, and `PSA_ALG_IS_WILDCARD()` will return true.

    This value must not be used to build other algorithms that are parametrized over a hash. For any valid use of this macro to build an algorithm ``alg``, :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_HASH_AND_SIGN(alg)` is true.

    This value cannot be used to build an algorithm specification to perform an operation. If used in this way, the operation will fail with an error.

    .. rubric:: Usage

    For example, suppose that ``PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE`` is one of the following macros:

    *   `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN`
    *   `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS`
    *   `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS_ANY_SALT`
    *   `PSA_ALG_ECDSA`
    *   `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA`
    *   `PSA_ALG_HASH_SLH_DSA`
    *   `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_HASH_SLH_DSA`
    *   `PSA_ALG_HASH_ML_DSA`
    *   `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_HASH_ML_DSA`

    The following sequence of operations shows how `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH` can be used in a key policy:

    1.  Set the key usage flags using `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH`, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_set_key_usage_flags(&attributes, PSA_KEY_USAGE_SIGN_MESSAGE); // or VERIFY_MESSAGE
            psa_set_key_algorithm(&attributes, PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE(PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH));

    #.  Import or generate key material.
    #.  Call `psa_sign_message()` or `psa_verify_message()`, passing an algorithm built from ``PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE`` and a specific hash. Each call to sign or verify a message can use a different hash algorithm.

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_sign_message(key, PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE(PSA_ALG_SHA_256), ...);
            psa_sign_message(key, PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE(PSA_ALG_SHA_512), ...);
            psa_sign_message(key, PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE(PSA_ALG_SHA3_256), ...);


.. macro:: PSA_SIGN_OUTPUT_SIZE
    :definition: /* implementation-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Sufficient signature buffer size for `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_sign_hash()`.

    .. param:: key_type
        An asymmetric key type. This can be a key-pair type or a public-key type.
    .. param:: key_bits
        The size of the key in bits.
    .. param:: alg
        The signature algorithm.

    .. return::
        A sufficient signature buffer size for the specified asymmetric signature algorithm and key parameters. An implementation can return either ``0`` or a correct size for an asymmetric signature algorithm and key parameters that it recognizes, but does not support. If the parameters are not valid, the return value is unspecified.

    If the size of the signature buffer is at least this large, it is guaranteed that `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_sign_hash()` will not fail due to an insufficient buffer size. The actual size of the output might be smaller in any given call.

    See also `PSA_SIGNATURE_MAX_SIZE`.

.. macro:: PSA_SIGNATURE_MAX_SIZE
    :definition: /* implementation-defined value */

    .. summary::
        A sufficient signature buffer size for `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_sign_hash()`, for any of the supported key types and asymmetric signature algorithms.

    If the size of the signature buffer is at least this large, it is guaranteed that `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_sign_hash()` will not fail due to an insufficient buffer size.

    See also `PSA_SIGN_OUTPUT_SIZE()`.
