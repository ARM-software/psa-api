Asymmetric signature
====================

An asymmetric signature algorithm provides two functions:

*   **Sign**: Calculate a message signature using a private, or secret, key.
*   **Verify**: Check that a signature matches a message using a public key.

Successful verification indicates that the message signature was calculated using the private key that is associated with the public key.

In the |API|, an asymmetric-sign function requires an asymmetric key pair; and an asymmetric-verify function requires an asymmetric public key or key pair.

.. rubric:: Signature schemes

The |API| supports the following signature schemes:

*   :secref:`rsa-sign-algorithms`
*   :secref:`ecdsa-sign-algorithms`
*   :secref:`eddsa-sign-algorithms`

.. rubric:: Types of signature algorithm

There are three categories of asymmetric signature algorithm in the |API|:

*   Hash-and-sign algorithms, that have two distinct phases:

    -   Calculate a hash of the message
    -   Calculate a signature over the hash

    For these algorithms, the asymmetric signature API allows applications to either calculate the full message signature, or calculate the signature of a pre-computed hash. For example, this enables the application to use a multi-part hash operation to calculate the hash of a large message, prior to calculating or verifying a signature on the calculated hash.

    The following algorithms are in this category:

    | `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN`
    | `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS`
    | `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS_ANY_SALT`
    | `PSA_ALG_ECDSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA`
    | `PSA_ALG_ED25519PH`
    | `PSA_ALG_ED448PH`

*   Message signature algorithms that do not separate the message processing from the signature calculations. This approach can provide better security against certain types of attack.

    For these algorithms, it is not possible to inject a pre-computed hash into the middle of the algorithm. An application can choose to calculate a message hash, and sign that instead of the message --- but this is not functionally equivalent to signing the message, and eliminates the security benefits of signing the message directly.

    Some of these algorithms still permit the signature of a large message to be calculated, or verified, by providing the message data in fragments. This is possible when the algorithm only processes the message data once. See the individual algorithm descriptions for details.

    The following algorithms are in this category:

    | `PSA_ALG_PURE_EDDSA`
      `PSA_ALG_EDDSA_CTX`

*   Specialized signature algorithms, that use part of a standard signature algorithm within a specific protocol. It is recommended that these algorithms are only used for that purpose, with inputs as specified by the higher-level protocol. See the individual algorithm descriptions for details on their usage.

    The following algorithms are in this category:

    | `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN_RAW`
    | `PSA_ALG_ECDSA_ANY`

.. rubric:: Signature functions

The |API| provides several functions for calculating and verifying signatures:

*   The single-part signature and verification functions, `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_verify_message()`, take a message as one of their inputs, and perform the sign or verify algorithm.

    These functions can be used on any hash-and-sign, or message signature, algorithms. See also `PSA_ALG_IS_SIGN_MESSAGE()`.

*   The single-part functions, `psa_sign_hash()` and `psa_verify_hash()`, typically take a message hash as one of their inputs, and perform the sign or verify algorithm.

    These functions can be used on any hash-and-sign signature algorithm. It is recommended that the input to these functions is a hash, computed using the corresponding hash algorithm. To determine which hash algorithm to use, the macro `PSA_ALG_GET_HASH()` can be called on the signature algorithm identifier.

    These functions can also be used on the specialized signature algorithms, with a hash or encoded-hash as input. See also `PSA_ALG_IS_SIGN_HASH()`.

*   Many modern signature algorithms have been designed to also accept a context to provide domain separation. Release 1.4 introduced four new functions that accept contexts: `psa_sign_message_with_context()` `psa_sign_hash_with_context()`, `psa_verify_message_with_context()` `psa_verify_hash_with_context()`.

    If called with a zero-length context, these functions produce the same signature as the original function.

    It is an error to provide a non-zero-length context with an algorithm that does not accept contexts.

    Code written to be cryptographically agile can use the new functions, provided it guards against providing a non-zero-length context with an algorithm that does not support  them.

    The ``PSA_ALG_SUPPORTS_CONTEXT`` macro can be used to determine if the implementation of an algorithm supports the use of non-zero-length contexts.

RSA signature algorithms
------------------------

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        The RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 message signature scheme, with hashing.

    .. param:: hash_alg
        A hash algorithm: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_HASH(hash_alg)` is true. This includes `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH` when specifying the algorithm in a key policy.

    .. return::
        The corresponding RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature algorithm.

        Unspecified if ``hash_alg`` is not a supported hash algorithm.

    This hash-and-sign signature algorithm can be used with both the message and hash signature functions.

    This signature scheme is defined by :RFC-title:`8017#8.2` under the name RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5.

    When used with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()`, the provided ``hash`` parameter is used as :math:`H` from step 2 onwards in the message encoding algorithm ``EMSA-PKCS1-V1_5-ENCODE()`` in :RFC:`8017#9.2`. :math:`H` is the message digest, computed using the ``hash_alg`` hash algorithm.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN_RAW
    :definition: ((psa_algorithm_t) 0x06000200)

    .. summary::
        The raw RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature algorithm, without hashing.

    This specialized signature algorithm can only be used with the `psa_sign_hash()` and `psa_verify_hash()` functions.

    This signature scheme is defined by :RFC-title:`8017#8.2` under the name RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5.

    The ``hash`` parameter to `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()` is used as :math:`T` from step 3 onwards in the message encoding algorithm ``EMSA-PKCS1-V1_5-ENCODE()`` in :RFC:`8017#9.2`. :math:`T` is normally the DER encoding of the *DigestInfo* structure produced by step 2 in the message encoding algorithm, but it can be any byte string within the available length.

    The wildcard key policy :code:`PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN(PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH)` also permits a key to be used with the `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN_RAW` signature algorithm.

    .. rationale::

        RSA keys that are used for TLS session establishment can be used in different versions of the TLS protocol.

        *   Versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the TLS protocol uses the `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN_RAW` algorithm, which signs an encoded SHA-1 + MD5 hash.
        *   Version 1.2 of the TLS protocol uses the :code:`PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN(PSA_ALG_SHA_256))` algorithm, which signs the [unencoded] SHA-256 hash.

    .. return::
        The corresponding RSA PSS signature algorithm.

        Unspecified if ``hash_alg`` is not a supported hash algorithm.

    This hash-and-sign signature algorithm can be used with both the message and hash signature functions.

    This algorithm is randomized: each invocation returns a different, equally valid signature.

    This is the signature scheme defined by :RFC:`8017#8.1` under the name RSASSA-PSS, with the following options:

    *   The mask generation function is *MGF1* defined by :RFC:`8017#B`.
    *   When creating a signature, the salt length is equal to the length of the hash, or the largest possible salt length for the algorithm and key size if that is smaller than the hash length.
    *   When verifying a signature, the salt length must be equal to the length of the hash, or the largest possible salt length for the algorithm and key size if that is smaller than the hash length.
    *   The specified hash algorithm, ``hash_alg``,  is used to hash the input message, to create the salted hash, and for the mask generation.

    When used with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()`, the provided ``hash`` parameter is the message digest, computed using the ``hash_alg`` hash algorithm.

    .. note::

        The `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS_ANY_SALT()` algorithm is equivalent to `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS()` when creating a signature, but permits any salt length when verifying a signature.

    *   The specified hash algorithm, ``hash_alg``,  is used to hash the input message, to create the salted hash, and for the mask generation.

    When used with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()`, the provided ``hash`` parameter is the message digest, computed using the ``hash_alg`` hash algorithm.

ECDSA signature algorithms

    .. param:: hash_alg
        A hash algorithm: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_HASH(hash_alg)` is true. This includes `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH` when specifying the algorithm in a key policy.

    .. return::
        The corresponding randomized ECDSA signature algorithm.

        Unspecified if ``hash_alg`` is not a supported hash algorithm.

    This hash-and-sign signature algorithm can be used with both the message and hash signature functions.

    When used with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()`, the provided ``hash`` parameter is the message digest, computed using the ``hash_alg`` hash algorithm.

    This algorithm is randomized: each invocation returns a different, equally valid signature.

    .. note::

        When based on the same hash algorithm, the verification operations for `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` and `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA` are identical. A signature created using `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` can be verified with the same key using either `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` or `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA`. Similarly, a signature created using `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA` can be verified with the same key using either `PSA_ALG_ECDSA` or `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA`.

        In particular, it is impossible to determine whether a signature was produced with deterministic ECDSA or with randomized ECDSA: it is only possible to verify that a signature was made with ECDSA with the private key corresponding to the public key used for the verification.

    This signature scheme is defined by :cite-title:`SEC1`, and also by :cite-title:`X9-62`, with a random per-message secret number :math:`k`.

    The representation of the signature as a byte string consists of the concatenation of the signature values :math:`r` and :math:`s`. Each of :math:`r` and :math:`s` is encoded as an :math:`N`-octet string, where :math:`N` is the length of the base point of the curve in octets. Each value is represented in big-endian order, with the most significant octet first.

EdDSA signature algorithms

    .. summary::
        Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm without pre-hashing (PureEdDSA), using standard parameters.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    This message signature algorithm can only be used with the `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_verify_message()` functions.

    This is the PureEdDSA digital signature algorithm defined by :RFC-title:`8032`, using standard parameters.

    PureEdDSA requires an elliptic curve key on a twisted Edwards curve. The following curves are supported:

    *   Edwards25519: the Ed25519 algorithm is computed. The output signature is a 64-byte string: the concatenation of :math:`R` and :math:`S` as defined by :RFC:`8032#5.1.6`.

    *   Edwards448: the Ed448 algorithm is computed. The output signature is a 114-byte string: the concatenation of :math:`R` and :math:`S` as defined by :RFC:`8032#5.2.6`.

    .. note::
        To sign or verify the pre-computed hash of a message using EdDSA, the HashEdDSA algorithms (`PSA_ALG_ED25519PH` and `PSA_ALG_ED448PH`) can be used.

        The signature produced by HashEdDSA is distinct from that produced by PureEdDSA.

    .. note::
        Signatures on the Edwards 25519 curve were originally defined without domain separation. Later the Ed25519ctx and Ed25519ph variants were defined, both of which accept a context. However, a signature made with Ed25519ctx and an zero-length context is distinct from a signature made using the Ed25519.

        As `PSA_ALG_PURE_EDDSA` does not support contexts, using PureEdDSA with a non-zero-length context is an error.

    .. summary::
        Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm with context, using the Edwards25519 or Edwards448 curves.

        .. versionadded:: 1.4

    This signature algorithm can be used with both the message and message with context signature functions. They cannot be used to sign hashes.

    This calculates the algorithm as specified in :RFC-title:`8032#5.1`, and requires an Edwards25519 or Edwards448 curve key. The `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_verify_message()` functions use an zero-length context when computing or verifying signatures.

    To use a non-zero-length context, use the signature functions that accept a context parameter, such as :code:`psa_sign_message_with_context()` and :code:`psa_verify_message_with_context()`

    .. admonition:: Implementation note

       Even if you supply an zero-length context, signatures created with Edwards25519 keys and PSA_ALG_EDDSA_CTX are distinct from those created with the same key PureEdDSA.

    .. subsection:: Usage

        This is a message signing algorithm. To calculate a signature, use one of the following approaches:

        *   Call `psa_sign_message()` or `psa_sign_message_with_context()` with the message.

        Verifying a signature is similar, using, for example, `psa_verify_message()` or `psa_verify_message_with_context()` instead of the signature function.

    .. summary::
        Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm with pre-hashing (HashEdDSA), using the Edwards25519 curve.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    This hash-and-sign signature algorithm can be used with both the message and hash signature functions.

    This calculates the Ed25519ph algorithm as specified in :RFC-title:`8032#5.1`, and requires an Edwards25519 curve key. The default signature functions use an zero-length context when computing or verifying signatures.

    To use a non-zero-length context, use the signature functions that accept a context parameter, such as :code:`psa_sign_hash_with_context()` and :code:`psa_verify_hash_with_context()`

    The pre-hash function is SHA-512, see `PSA_ALG_SHA_512`.

    When used with any of these functions, the provided ``hash`` parameter is the SHA-512 message digest.

    .. subsection:: Usage

        This is a hash-and-sign algorithm. To calculate a signature, use one of the following approaches:

        *   Call `psa_sign_message()` or `psa_sign_message_with_context()` with the message.

        *   Calculate the SHA-512 hash of the message with `psa_hash_compute()`, or with a multi-part hash operation, using the hash algorithm `PSA_ALG_SHA_512`. Then sign the calculated hash with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_sign_hash_with_context()`.

        Verifying a signature is similar, using, for example, `psa_verify_message_with_context()` or `psa_verify_hash()` instead of the signature function.

    .. admonition:: Implementation note

        When used with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash()`, the ``hash`` parameter to the call should be used as :math:`\text{PH}(M)` in the algorithms defined in :RFC:`8032#5.1`.

    .. summary::
        Edwards-curve digital signature algorithm with pre-hashing (HashEdDSA), using the Edwards448 curve.

        .. versionadded:: 1.1

    This hash-and-sign signature algorithm can be used with both the message and hash signature functions.

    This calculates the Ed448ph algorithm as specified in :RFC-title:`8032#5.2`, and requires an Edwards448 curve key.

    The pre-hash function is the first 64 bytes of the output from SHAKE256, see `PSA_ALG_SHAKE256_512`.

    When used these functions, the provided ``hash`` parameter is the truncated SHAKE256 message digest.

    The default signature functions use the empty string as the context, that is they use  a zero-length context. To use a non-zero-length context, use one of the functions that support supplied contexts, for example `psa_sign_hash_with_context()` or `psa_verify_message_with_context()`.

    .. subsection:: Usage

        This is a hash-and-sign algorithm. To calculate a signature, use one of the following approaches:

        *   Call `psa_sign_message()`, or `psa_sign_message_with_context()` with the message.

        *   Calculate the first 64 bytes of the SHAKE256 output of the message with `psa_hash_compute()`, or with a multi-part hash operation, using the hash algorithm `PSA_ALG_SHAKE256_512`. Then sign the calculated hash with `psa_sign_hash()` or `psa_sign_hash_with_context()`.

        Verifying a signature is similar, using `psa_verify_message()`, `psa_verify_message_with_context()`,`psa_verify_hash()` or `psa_verify_hash_with_context()` instead of the signature function.

Support macros
--------------

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_IS_SIGN_MESSAGE
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether the specified algorithm is a signature algorithm that can be used with `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_verify_message()`.

    .. param:: alg
        An algorithm identifier: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t`.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` is a signature algorithm that can be used to sign a message. ``0`` if ``alg`` is a signature algorithm that can only be used to sign a pre-computed hash. ``0`` if ``alg`` is not a signature algorithm. This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported algorithm identifier.

    This macro evaluates to ``1`` for hash-and-sign and message-signature algorithms.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_IS_SIGN_HASH
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether the specified algorithm is a signature algorithm that can be used with `psa_sign_hash()` and `psa_verify_hash()`.

    .. param:: alg
        An algorithm identifier: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t`.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` is a signature algorithm that can be used to sign a hash. ``0`` if ``alg`` is a signature algorithm that can only be used to sign a message. ``0`` if ``alg`` is not a signature algorithm. This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported algorithm identifier.

    This macro evaluates to ``1`` for hash-and-sign and specialized signature algorithms.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_IS_HASH_AND_SIGN
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether the specified algorithm is a hash-and-sign algorithm that signs exactly the hash value.

    .. param:: alg
        An algorithm identifier: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t`.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` is a hash-and-sign algorithm that signs exactly the hash value, ``0`` otherwise. This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported algorithm identifier.

        A wildcard signature algorithm policy, using `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH`, returns the same value as the signature algorithm parameterized with a valid hash algorithm.

    This macro identifies algorithms that can be used with `psa_sign_hash()` that use the exact message hash value as an input the signature operation. For example, if :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_HASH_AND_SIGN(alg)` is true, the following call sequence is equivalent to :code:`psa_sign_message(key, alg, msg, msg_len, ...)`:

    .. code-block:: xref

        uint8_t hash[PSA_HASH_MAX_SIZE];
        size_t hash_len;
        psa_hash_compute(PSA_ALG_GET_HASH(alg), msg, msg_len,
                         hash, sizeof(hash), &hash_len);
        psa_sign_hash(key, alg, hash, hash_len, ...);

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_SUPPORTS_CONTEXT
    :definition: /* specification-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Whether the implementation of the specified algorithm supports contexts.

    .. param:: alg
        An algorithm identifier: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t`.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` supports use of contexts, ``0`` otherwise. This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported algorithm identifier.

        A wildcard signature algorithm policy, using `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH`, returns the same value as the signature algorithm parameterized with a valid hash algorithm.

    This macro identifies algorithms that can be used with the functions that support non-zero-length contexts, for example `psa_sign_message_with_context()` or `psa_verify_hash_with_context()`.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH
    :definition: ((psa_algorithm_t)0x020000ff)

    .. summary::
        When setting a hash-and-sign algorithm in a key policy, permit any hash algorithm.

    This value can be used to form the permitted-algorithm attribute of a key policy for a signature algorithm that is parametrized by a hash. A key with this policy can then be used to perform operations using the same signature algorithm parametrized with any supported hash.
    A signature algorithm created using this macro is a wildcard algorithm, and `PSA_ALG_IS_WILDCARD()` will return true.

    This value must not be used to build other algorithms that are parametrized over a hash. For any valid use of this macro to build an algorithm ``alg``, :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_HASH_AND_SIGN(alg)` is true.

    This value cannot be used to build an algorithm specification to perform an operation. If used in this way, the operation will fail with an error.

    .. rubric:: Usage

    For example, suppose that ``PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE`` is one of the following macros:

    *   `PSA_ALG_RSA_PKCS1V15_SIGN`
    *   `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS`
    *   `PSA_ALG_RSA_PSS_ANY_SALT`
    *   `PSA_ALG_ECDSA`
    *   `PSA_ALG_DETERMINISTIC_ECDSA`

    The following sequence of operations shows how `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH` can be used in a key policy:

    1.  Set the key usage flags using `PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH`, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_set_key_usage_flags(&attributes, PSA_KEY_USAGE_SIGN_MESSAGE); // or VERIFY_MESSAGE
            psa_set_key_algorithm(&attributes, PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE(PSA_ALG_ANY_HASH));

    #.  Import or generate key material.
    #.  Call `psa_sign_message()` or `psa_verify_message()`, passing an algorithm built from ``PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE`` and a specific hash. Each call to sign or verify a message can use a different hash algorithm.

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_sign_message(key, PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE(PSA_ALG_SHA_256), ...);
            psa_sign_message(key, PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE(PSA_ALG_SHA_512), ...);
            psa_sign_message(key, PSA_xxx_SIGNATURE(PSA_ALG_SHA3_256), ...);


.. macro:: PSA_SIGN_OUTPUT_SIZE
    :definition: /* implementation-defined value */

    .. summary::
        Sufficient signature buffer size for `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_sign_hash()`.

    .. param:: key_type
        An asymmetric key type. This can be a key-pair type or a public-key type.
    .. param:: key_bits
        The size of the key in bits.
    .. param:: alg
        The signature algorithm.

    .. return::
        A sufficient signature buffer size for the specified asymmetric signature algorithm and key parameters. An implementation can return either ``0`` or a correct size for an asymmetric signature algorithm and key parameters that it recognizes, but does not support. If the parameters are not valid, the return value is unspecified.

    If the size of the signature buffer is at least this large, it is guaranteed that `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_sign_hash()` will not fail due to an insufficient buffer size. The actual size of the output might be smaller in any given call.

    See also `PSA_SIGNATURE_MAX_SIZE`.

.. macro:: PSA_SIGNATURE_MAX_SIZE
    :definition: /* implementation-defined value */

    .. summary::
        A sufficient signature buffer size for `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_sign_hash()`, for any of the supported key types and asymmetric signature algorithms.

    If the size of the signature buffer is at least this large, it is guaranteed that `psa_sign_message()` and `psa_sign_hash()` will not fail due to an insufficient buffer size.

    See also `PSA_SIGN_OUTPUT_SIZE()`.
