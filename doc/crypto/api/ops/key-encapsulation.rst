Key encapsulation
=================

A key-encapsulation algorithm can be used by two participants to establish a shared secret key over a public channel.
The shared secret key can then be used with symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms.
Key-encapsulation algorithms are often referred to as 'key-encapsulation mechanisms' or KEMs.

In a key-encapsulation algorithm, participants A and B establish a shared secret as follows:

1.  Participant A generates a key pair: a private decapsulation key, and a public encapsulation key.
#.  The public encapsulation key is made available to participant B.
#.  Participant B uses the encapsulation key to generate one copy of a shared secret, and some ciphertext.
#.  The ciphertext is transferred to participant A.
#.  Participant A uses the private decapsulation key to compute another copy of the shared secret.

Typically, the shared secret is used as input to a key-derivation function, to create keys for secure communication between participants A and B.
However, some key-encapsulation algorithms result in a uniformly pseudorandom shared secret, which is suitable to be used directly as a cryptographic key.

Applications can use the resulting keys for different use cases.
For example:

*   Encrypting and authenticating a single non-interactive message from participant B to participant A.
*   Securing an interactive communication channel between participants A and B.

Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme
-------------------------------------------

The Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) was first proposed by Shoup, then improved by Ballare and Rogaway.

The original specification permitted a number of variants.
The |API| uses the version specified in :cite-title:`SEC1`.

The full ECIES scheme uses an elliptic-curve key agreement between the recipient's static public key and an ephemeral private key, to establish encryption and authentication keys for secure transmission of arbitrary-length messages to the recipient.

An application using ECIES must select all of the following parameters:

*   The elliptic curve for the initial key agreement.
*   The KDF to derive the symmetric keys, and any label used in that derivation.
*   The encryption and MAC algorithms.
*   The additional data to include when computing the authentication.

The |API| presents the key-agreement step of ECIES as a key-encapsulation algorithm.
The key derivation, encryption, and authentication steps are left to the application.

.. rationale::

    Although it is possible to implement this in an application using key generation and key agreement, using the key-encapsulation functions enables an easy migration to other key-encapsulation algorithms, such as ML-KEM.

.. admonition:: Implementation note

    It is possible that some applications may need to use alternative versions of ECIES to interoperate with legacy systems.

    While the application can implement this using key agreement functions, an implementation can choose to add these as a convenience with an :scterm:`implementation defined` key-encapsulation algorithm identifier.

    :definition: ((psa_algorithm_t)0x0c000100)

    .. summary::
        The Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES).

        .. versionadded:: 1.3

    This key-encapsulation algorithm is defined by :cite-title:`SEC1` ยง5.1 under the name Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme.

    A call to `psa_encapsulate()` carries out steps 1 to 4 of the ECIES encryption process described in `[SEC1]` ยง5.1.3:

    *   The elliptic curve to use is determined by the key.
    *   The public-key part of the input key is used as :math:`Q_V`.
    *   Cofactor ECDH is used to perform the key agreement.
    *   The octet string :math:`Z` is output as the shared secret key.
    *   The ephemeral public key :math:`\overline{R}` is output as the ciphertext.

    A call to `psa_decapsulate()` carries out steps 2 to 5 of the ECIES decryption process described in `[SEC1]` ยง5.1.4:

    *   The elliptic curve to use is determined by the key.
    *   The ciphertext is decoded as :math:`\overline{R}`.
    *   The private key of the input key is used as :math:`d_V`.
    *   Cofactor ECDH is used to perform the key agreement.
    *   The octet string :math:`Z` is output as the shared secret key.

    The ciphertext produced by `PSA_ALG_ECIES_SEC1` is not authenticated.
    In the full ECIES scheme, the authentication of the encrypted message using a key derived from the shared secret provides assurance that the message has not been manipulated.

    The shared secret key that is produced by `PSA_ALG_ECIES_SEC1` is not suitable for use as an encryption key.
    It must be used as an input to a key derivation operation to produce additional cryptographic keys.

        | :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_ECC_KEY_PAIR(family)`
        | :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_ECC_PUBLIC_KEY(family)` (encapsulaton only)

        where ``family`` is a Weierstrass or Montgomery Elliptic curve family.
        That is, one of the following values:

        *   ``PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECT_XX``

.. function:: psa_encapsulate

    .. summary::
        Use a public key to generate a new shared secret key and associated ciphertext.

        .. versionadded:: 1.3

    .. param:: psa_key_id_t key
        Identifier of the key to use for the encapsulation.
        It must be a public key or an asymmetric key pair.
        It must permit the usage `PSA_KEY_USAGE_ENCRYPT`.
    .. param:: psa_algorithm_t alg
        The key-encapsulation algorithm to use: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_KEY_ENCAPSULATION(alg)` is true.
    .. param:: const psa_key_attributes_t * attributes
        The attributes for the output key.
        This function uses the attributes as follows:

        *   The key type.
            All key-encapsulation algorithms can output a key of type :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_DERIVE` or :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_HMAC`.
            Key-encapsulation algorithms that produce a uniformly pseudorandom shared secret, can also output block-cipher key types, for example :code:`PSA_KEY_TYPE_AES`.
            Refer to the documentation of individual key-encapsulation algorithms for more information.

        The following attributes must be set for keys used in cryptographic operations:

        *   The key permitted-algorithm policy, see :secref:`permitted-algorithms`.
        *   The key usage flags, see :secref:`key-usage-flags`.

        The following attributes must be set for keys that do not use the default `PSA_KEY_LIFETIME_VOLATILE` lifetime:

        *   The key lifetime, see :secref:`key-lifetimes`.
        *   The key identifier is required for a key with a persistent lifetime, see :secref:`key-identifiers`.

        The following attributes are optional:

        *   If the key size is nonzero, it must be equal to the size, in bits, of the shared secret.

        .. note::
            This is an input parameter: it is not updated with the final key attributes.

        Buffer where the ciphertext output is to be written.
    .. param:: size_t ciphertext_size
        Size of the ``ciphertext`` buffer in bytes.
        This must be appropriate for the selected algorithm and key:

        *   A sufficient ciphertext size is :code:`PSA_ENCAPSULATE_CIPHERTEXT_SIZE(type, bits, alg)`, where ``type`` and ``bits`` are the type and bit-size of ``key``.
        *   `PSA_ENCAPSULATE_CIPHERTEXT_MAX_SIZE` evaluates to the maximum ciphertext size of any supported key-encapsulation algorithm.
    .. param:: size_t * ciphertext_length
        On success, the number of bytes that make up the ciphertext value.

    .. return:: psa_status_t

    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success.
        The bytes of ``ciphertext`` contain the data to be sent to the other participant, and ``output_key`` contains the identifier for the shared secret key.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE
        ``key`` is not a valid key identifier.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_PERMITTED
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   ``key`` does not have the `PSA_KEY_USAGE_ENCRYPT` flag, or it does not permit the requested algorithm.
        *   The implementation does not permit creating a key with the specified attributes due to some implementation-specific policy.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS
        This is an attempt to create a persistent key, and there is already a persistent key with the given identifier.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   ``alg`` is not supported or is not a key-encapsulation algorithm.
        *   ``key`` is not supported for use with ``alg``.
        *   The output key attributes in ``attributes``, as a whole, are not supported, either by the implementation in general or in the specified storage location.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   ``alg`` is not a key-encapsulation algorithm.
        *   ``key`` is not a public key or an asymmetric key pair, that is compatible with ``alg``.
        *   The output key attributes in ``attributes`` are not valid:

            -   The key type is not valid for the shared secret.
            -   The key size is nonzero, and is not the size of the shared secret.
            -   The key lifetime is invalid.

            -   The key attributes, as a whole, are invalid.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL
        The size of the ``ciphertext`` buffer is too small.

    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The library requires initializing by a call to `psa_crypto_init()`.

    The ``output_key`` location, policy, and type are taken from ``attributes``.

    The size of the returned key is always the bit-size of the shared secret, rounded up to a whole number of bytes.
    The size of the shared secret is dependent on the key-encapsulation algorithm and the type and size of ``key``.

    It is recommended that the shared secret key is used as an input to a key derivation operation to produce additional cryptographic keys.
    For some key-encapsulation algorithms, the shared secret key is also suitable for use as a key in cryptographic operations such as encryption.
    Refer to the documentation of individual key-encapsulation algorithms for more information.

    The output ``ciphertext`` is to be sent to the other participant, who uses the decapsulation key to extract another copy of the shared secret key.

    The ``output_key`` location, policy, and type are taken from ``attributes``.

    The size of the returned key is always the bit-size of the shared secret, rounded up to a whole number of bytes.
    The size of the shared secret is dependent on the key-encapsulation algorithm and the type and size of ``key``.

    Refer to the documentation of individual key-encapsulation algorithms for more information.

    If the key-encapsulation protocol is executed correctly then, with overwhelming probability, the two copies of the shared secret are identical.
    However, the protocol does not protect one participant against the other participant executing it incorrectly, or against a third party modifying data in transit.

    .. warning::
        A :code:`PSA_SUCCESS` result from `psa_decapsulate()` does not guarantee that the output key is identical to the key produced by the call to `psa_encapsulate()`. For example, :code:`PSA_SUCCESS` can be returned with a mismatched shared secret key value in the following situations:

        *   The key-encapsulation algorithm does not authenticate the ciphertext.
            Manipulated or corrupted ciphertext will not be detected during decapsulation.
        *   The key-encapsulation algorithm reports authentication failure implicitly, by returning a pseudorandom key value.
            This is done to prevent disclosing information to an attacker that has manipulated the ciphertext.
        *   The key-encapsulation algorithm is probablistic, and will *extremely* rarely result in non-identical key values.

        It is strongly recommended that the application uses the output key in a way that will confirm that the shared secret keys are identical.

    .. admonition:: Implementation note

        For key-encapsulation algorithms which involve data padding when computing the ciphertext, the decapsulation algorithm **must not** report a distinct error status if invalid padding is detected.

        Instead, it is recommended that the decapsulation fails implicitly when invalid padding is detected, returning a pseudorandom key.
