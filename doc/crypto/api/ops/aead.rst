Authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
====================================================

The single-part AEAD functions are:

*   `psa_aead_encrypt()` to encrypt a message using an authenticated symmetric cipher.
*   `psa_aead_decrypt()` to decrypt a message using an authenticated symmetric cipher.

These functions follow the interface recommended by :RFC-title:`5116`.

The encryption function requires a nonce to be provided. To generate a random nonce, either call `psa_generate_random()` or use the AEAD multi-part API.

The `psa_aead_operation_t` `multi-part operation <multi-part-operations>` permits alternative initialization parameters and allows messages to be processed in fragments. A multi-part AEAD operation is used as follows:

1.  Initialize the `psa_aead_operation_t` object to zero, or by assigning the value of the associated macro `PSA_AEAD_OPERATION_INIT`.
#.  Call `psa_aead_encrypt_setup()` or `psa_aead_decrypt_setup()` to specify the algorithm and key.
#.  Provide additional parameters:

    -   If the algorithm requires it, call `psa_aead_set_lengths()` to specify the length of the non-encrypted and encrypted inputs to the operation.
    -   When encrypting, call either `psa_aead_generate_nonce()` or `psa_aead_set_nonce()` to generate or set the nonce.
    -   When decrypting, call `psa_aead_set_nonce()` to set the nonce.
#.  Call `psa_aead_update_ad()` zero or more times with fragments of the non-encrypted additional data.
#.  Call `psa_aead_update()` zero or more times with fragments of the plaintext or ciphertext to encrypt or decrypt.
#.  At the end of the message, call the required finishing function:

    -   To complete an encryption operation, call `psa_aead_finish()` to compute and return authentication tag.
    -   To complete a decryption operation, call `psa_aead_verify()` to compute the authentication tag and verify it against a reference value.

To abort the operation or recover from an error, call `psa_aead_abort()`.

.. note::
    Using a multi-part interface to authenticated encryption raises specific issues.

    *   Multi-part authenticated decryption produces intermediate results that are not authenticated. Revealing unauthenticated results, either directly or indirectly through the application’s behavior, can compromise the confidentiality of all inputs that are encrypted with the same key. See the :ref:`detailed warning <aead-multi-part-warning>`.

    *   For encryption, some common algorithms cannot be processed in a streaming fashion. For SIV mode, the whole plaintext must be known before the encryption can start; the multi-part AEAD API is not meant to be usable with SIV mode. For CCM mode, the length of the plaintext must be known before the encryption can start; the application can call the function `psa_aead_set_lengths()` to provide these lengths before providing input.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_CCM
    :definition: ((psa_algorithm_t)0x05500100)

    .. summary::
        The *Counter with CBC-MAC* (CCM) authenticated encryption algorithm.

    CCM is defined for block ciphers that have a 128-bit block size. The underlying block cipher is determined by the key type.

    To use `PSA_ALG_CCM` with a multi-part AEAD operation, the application must call `psa_aead_set_lengths()` before providing the nonce, the additional data and plaintext to the operation.

    CCM requires a nonce of between 7 and 13 bytes in length. The length of the nonce affects the maximum length of the plaintext than can be encrypted or decrypted. If the nonce has length :math:`N`, then the plaintext length :math:`pLen` is encoded in :math:`L = 15 - N` octets, this requires that :math:`pLen < 2^{8L}`.

    The value for :math:`L` that is used with `PSA_ALG_CCM` depends on the function used to provide the nonce:

    *   A call to `psa_aead_encrypt()`, `psa_aead_decrypt()`, or `psa_aead_set_nonce()` will set :math:`L = 15 - \mathtt{nonce\_length}`. If the plaintext length cannot be encoded in :math:`L` octets, then a :code:`PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.

    *   A call to `psa_aead_generate_nonce()` on a multi-part cipher operation will select the smallest integer :math:`L \geq 2`, where :math:`pLen < 2^{8L}`, with :math:`pLen` being the ``plaintext_length`` provided to `psa_aead_set_lengths()`. The call to `psa_aead_generate_nonce()` will generate and return a random nonce of length :math:`15 - L` bytes.

    CCM supports authentication tag sizes of 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 bytes. The default tag length is 16. Shortened tag lengths can be requested using :code:`PSA_ALG_AEAD_WITH_SHORTENED_TAG(PSA_ALG_CCM, tag_length)`, where ``tag_length`` is a valid CCM tag length.

    The CCM block cipher mode is defined in :RFC-title:`3610`.

    .. subsection:: Usage in Zigbee

        The CCM* algorithm is required by :cite-title:`ZIGBEE`.

        *   `PSA_ALG_CCM`, and its truncated variants, can be used to implement CCM* for non-zero tag lengths.
        *   For unauthenticated CCM*, with a zero-length tag, use the `PSA_ALG_CCM_STAR_NO_TAG` cipher algorithm.

        See also :ref:`Usage in Zigbee <using-ccm-star-no-tag>` under `PSA_ALG_CCM_STAR_NO_TAG`.

    :definition: ((psa_algorithm_t)0x05500200)

    .. summary::
        The *Galois/Counter Mode* (GCM) authenticated encryption algorithm.

    GCM is defined for block ciphers that have a 128-bit block size. The underlying block cipher is determined by the key type.

    GCM requires a nonce of at least 1 byte in length. The maximum supported nonce size is :scterm:`implementation defined`. Calling `psa_aead_generate_nonce()` will generate a random 12-byte nonce.

    GCM supports authentication tag sizes of 4, 8, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 bytes. The default tag length is 16. Shortened tag lengths can be requested using :code:`PSA_ALG_AEAD_WITH_SHORTENED_TAG(PSA_ALG_GCM, tag_length)`, where ``tag_length`` is a valid GCM tag length.

    The GCM block cipher mode is defined in :cite-title:`SP800-38D`.

.. macro:: PSA_ALG_CHACHA20_POLY1305
    :definition: ((psa_algorithm_t)0x05100500)

    .. summary::
        The ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD algorithm.

    There are two defined variants of ChaCha20-Poly1305:

    *   An implementation that supports ChaCha20-Poly1305 must support the variant defined by :rfc-title:`8439`, which has a 96-bit nonce and 32-bit counter.
    *   An implementation can optionally also support the original variant defined by :cite-title:`CHACHA20`, which has a 64-bit nonce and 64-bit counter.

    The variant used for the AEAD encryption or decryption operation, depends on the nonce provided for an AEAD operation using `PSA_ALG_CHACHA20_POLY1305`:

    *   A nonce provided in a call to `psa_aead_encrypt()`, `psa_aead_decrypt()` or `psa_aead_set_nonce()` must be 8 or 12 bytes. The size of nonce will select the appropriate variant of the algorithm.

    *   A nonce generated by a call to `psa_aead_generate_nonce()` will be 12 bytes, and will use the :rfc:`8439` variant.

    Implementations must support 16-byte tags. It is recommended that truncated tag sizes are rejected.

        The XChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD algorithm.

        .. versionadded:: 1.2

    XChaCha20-Poly1305 is a variation of the ChaCha20-Poly1305 AEAD algorithm, but uses a 192-bit nonce. The larger nonce provides much lower probability of nonce misuse.

    XChaCha20-Poly1305 requires a 24-byte nonce.

    Implementations must support 16-byte tags. It is recommended that truncated tag sizes are rejected.

    XChaCha20-Poly1305 is defined in :cite-title:`XCHACHA`.

        Macro to build a AEAD algorithm with a shortened tag.

    .. param:: aead_alg
        An AEAD algorithm: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_AEAD(aead_alg)` is true.
    .. param:: tag_length
        Desired length of the authentication tag in bytes.

        The corresponding AEAD algorithm with the specified tag length.

        Unspecified if ``aead_alg`` is not a supported AEAD algorithm or if ``tag_length`` is not valid for the specified AEAD algorithm.

    An AEAD algorithm with a shortened tag is similar to the corresponding AEAD algorithm, but has an authentication tag that consists of fewer bytes. Depending on the algorithm, the tag length might affect the calculation of the ciphertext.

    The AEAD algorithm with a default length tag can be recovered using `PSA_ALG_AEAD_WITH_DEFAULT_LENGTH_TAG()`.

    .. subsection:: Compatible key types

        The resulting AEAD algorithm is compatible with the same key types as the AEAD algorithm used to construct it.

        The corresponding AEAD algorithm with the default tag length for that algorithm.

    This macro can be used to construct the AEAD algorithm with default tag length from an AEAD algorithm with a shortened tag. See also `PSA_ALG_AEAD_WITH_SHORTENED_TAG()`.

    .. param:: aead_alg
        An AEAD algorithm: a value of type `psa_algorithm_t` such that :code:`PSA_ALG_IS_AEAD(aead_alg)` is true.
    .. param:: min_tag_length
        Desired minimum length of the authentication tag in bytes. This must be at least ``1`` and at most the largest permitted tag length of the algorithm.

    .. return::
        The corresponding AEAD wildcard algorithm with the specified minimum tag length.

        Unspecified if ``aead_alg`` is not a supported AEAD algorithm or if ``min_tag_length`` is less than ``1`` or too large for the specified AEAD algorithm.

    A key with a minimum-tag-length AEAD wildcard algorithm as permitted-algorithm policy can be used with all AEAD algorithms sharing the same base algorithm, and where the tag length of the specific algorithm is equal to or larger then the minimum tag length specified by the wildcard algorithm.

    .. note::
        When setting the minimum required tag length to less than the smallest tag length permitted by the base algorithm, this effectively becomes an 'any-tag-length-permitted' policy for that base algorithm.

    The AEAD algorithm with a default length tag can be recovered using `PSA_ALG_AEAD_WITH_DEFAULT_LENGTH_TAG()`.

    .. subsection:: Compatible key types

        The resulting wildcard AEAD algorithm is compatible with the same key types as the AEAD algorithm used to construct it.

Multi-part AEAD operations
--------------------------

.. _aead-multi-part-warning:

.. warning::
    When decrypting using a multi-part AEAD operation, there is no guarantee that the input or output is valid until `psa_aead_verify()` has returned :code:`PSA_SUCCESS`.

    A call to `psa_aead_update()` or `psa_aead_update_ad()` returning :code:`PSA_SUCCESS` **does not** indicate that the input and output is valid.

    Until an application calls `psa_aead_verify()` and it has returned :code:`PSA_SUCCESS`, the following rules apply to input and output data from a multi-part AEAD operation:

    *   Do not trust the input. If the application takes any action that depends on the input data, this action will need to be undone if the input turns out to be invalid.

    *   Store the output in a confidential location. In particular, the application must not copy the output to a memory or storage space which is shared.

    *   Do not trust the output. If the application takes any action that depends on the tentative decrypted data, this action will need to be undone if the input turns out to be invalid. Furthermore, if an adversary can observe that this action took place, for example, through timing, they might be able to use this fact as an oracle to decrypt any message encrypted with the same key.

    An application that does not follow these rules might be vulnerable to maliciously constructed AEAD input data.


.. typedef:: /* implementation-defined type */ psa_aead_operation_t

    .. summary::
        The type of the state object for multi-part AEAD operations.

    Before calling any function on an AEAD operation object, the application must initialize it by any of the following means:

    *   Set the object to all-bits-zero, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_aead_operation_t operation;
            memset(&operation, 0, sizeof(operation));

    *   Initialize the object to logical zero values by declaring the object as static or global without an explicit initializer, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            static psa_aead_operation_t operation;

    *   Initialize the object to the initializer `PSA_AEAD_OPERATION_INIT`, for example:

        .. code-block:: xref

            psa_aead_operation_t operation = PSA_AEAD_OPERATION_INIT;

    *   Assign the result of the function `psa_aead_operation_init()` to the object, for example:

    #.  Call `psa_aead_encrypt_setup()` to specify the algorithm and key.
    #.  If needed, call `psa_aead_set_lengths()` to specify the length of the inputs to the subsequent calls to `psa_aead_update_ad()` and `psa_aead_update()`. See the documentation of `psa_aead_set_lengths()` for details.
    #.  Call either `psa_aead_generate_nonce()` or `psa_aead_set_nonce()` to generate or set the nonce. It is recommended to use `psa_aead_generate_nonce()` unless the protocol being implemented requires a specific nonce value.
    #.  Call `psa_aead_update_ad()` zero, one or more times, passing a fragment of the non-encrypted additional authenticated data each time.
    #.  Call `psa_aead_update()` zero, one or more times, passing a fragment of the message to encrypt each time.
    #.  Call `psa_aead_finish()`.

    After a successful call to `psa_aead_encrypt_setup()`, the operation is active, and the application must eventually terminate the operation. The following events terminate an operation:

    *   A successful call to `psa_aead_finish()`.
    *   A call to `psa_aead_abort()`.

    If `psa_aead_encrypt_setup()` returns an error, the operation object is unchanged. If a subsequent function call with an active operation returns an error, the operation enters an error state.

    To abandon an active operation, or reset an operation in an error state, call `psa_aead_abort()`.

    The sequence of operations to decrypt a message with authentication is as follows:

    1.  Allocate an AEAD operation object which will be passed to all the functions listed here.
    #.  Initialize the operation object with one of the methods described in the documentation for `psa_aead_operation_t`, e.g. `PSA_AEAD_OPERATION_INIT`.
    #.  Call `psa_aead_decrypt_setup()` to specify the algorithm and key.
    #.  If needed, call `psa_aead_set_lengths()` to specify the length of the inputs to the subsequent calls to `psa_aead_update_ad()` and `psa_aead_update()`. See the documentation of `psa_aead_set_lengths()` for details.
    #.  Call `psa_aead_set_nonce()` with the nonce for the decryption.
    #.  Call `psa_aead_update_ad()` zero, one or more times, passing a fragment of the non-encrypted additional authenticated data each time.
    #.  Call `psa_aead_update()` zero, one or more times, passing a fragment of the ciphertext to decrypt each time.
    #.  Call `psa_aead_verify()`.

    After a successful call to `psa_aead_decrypt_setup()`, the operation is active, and the application must eventually terminate the operation. The following events terminate an operation:

    *   A successful call to `psa_aead_verify()`.
    *   A call to `psa_aead_abort()`.

    If `psa_aead_decrypt_setup()` returns an error, the operation object is unchanged. If a subsequent function call with an active operation returns an error, the operation enters an error state.

    To abandon an active operation, or reset an operation in an error state, call `psa_aead_abort()`.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The following conditions can result in this error:

    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED
        ``ad_length`` or ``plaintext_length`` are too large for the implementation.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED

    The application must call this function before calling `psa_aead_set_nonce()` or `psa_aead_generate_nonce()`, if the algorithm for the operation requires it. If the algorithm does not require it, calling this function is optional, but if this function is called then the implementation must enforce the lengths.

    *   For `PSA_ALG_CCM`, calling this function is required.
    *   For the other AEAD algorithms defined in this specification, calling this function is not required.
    *   For vendor-defined algorithm, refer to the vendor documentation.

    If this function returns an error status, the operation enters an error state and must be aborted by calling `psa_aead_abort()`.

.. function:: psa_aead_generate_nonce

        Generate a random nonce for an authenticated encryption operation.

    .. param:: psa_aead_operation_t * operation
        Active AEAD operation.
    .. param:: uint8_t * nonce
        Buffer where the generated nonce is to be written.
    .. param:: size_t nonce_size
        Size of the ``nonce`` buffer in bytes. This must be appropriate for the selected algorithm and key:

        *   A sufficient output size is :code:`PSA_AEAD_NONCE_LENGTH(key_type, alg)` where ``key_type`` is the type of key and ``alg`` is the algorithm that were used to set up the operation.
        *   `PSA_AEAD_NONCE_MAX_SIZE` evaluates to a sufficient output size for any supported AEAD algorithm.
    .. param:: size_t * nonce_length
        On success, the number of bytes of the generated nonce.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success.
        The first ``(*nonce_length)`` bytes of ``nonce`` contain the generated nonce.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The operation state is not valid: it must be an active AEAD encryption operation, with no nonce set.
        *   The operation state is not valid: this is an algorithm which requires `psa_aead_set_lengths()` to be called before setting the nonce.
        *   The library requires initializing by a call to `psa_crypto_init()`.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL
        The size of the ``nonce`` buffer is too small. `PSA_AEAD_NONCE_LENGTH()` or `PSA_AEAD_NONCE_MAX_SIZE` can be used to determine a sufficient buffer size.

    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_CORRUPT
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_INVALID

    This function generates a random nonce for the authenticated encryption operation with an appropriate size for the chosen algorithm, key type and key size.

    Most algorithms generate a default-length nonce, as returned by `PSA_AEAD_NONCE_LENGTH()`. Some algorithms can return a shorter nonce from `psa_aead_generate_nonce()`, see the individual algorithm descriptions for details.

    The application must call `psa_aead_encrypt_setup()` before calling this function. If applicable for the algorithm, the application must call `psa_aead_set_lengths()` before calling this function.

    If this function returns an error status, the operation enters an error state and must be aborted by calling `psa_aead_abort()`.

    .. param:: const uint8_t * nonce
        Buffer containing the nonce to use.
    .. param:: size_t nonce_length
        Size of the nonce in bytes. This must be a valid nonce size for the chosen algorithm. The default nonce size is :code:`PSA_AEAD_NONCE_LENGTH(key_type, alg)` where ``key_type`` and ``alg`` are type of key and the algorithm respectively that were used to set up the AEAD operation.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success.

        *   The library requires initializing by a call to `psa_crypto_init()`.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT

    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_STORAGE_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_CORRUPT
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_DATA_INVALID

    This function sets the nonce for the authenticated encryption or decryption operation.

    The application must call `psa_aead_encrypt_setup()` or `psa_aead_decrypt_setup()` before calling this function. If applicable for the algorithm, the application must call `psa_aead_set_lengths()` before calling this function.

    If this function returns an error status, the operation enters an error state and must be aborted by calling `psa_aead_abort()`.

    .. note::
        When encrypting, `psa_aead_generate_nonce()` is recommended instead of using this function, unless implementing a protocol that requires a non-random IV.

.. function:: psa_aead_update_ad

    .. summary::

    Additional data is authenticated, but not encrypted.

    This function can be called multiple times to pass successive fragments of the additional data. This function must not be called after passing data to encrypt or decrypt with `psa_aead_update()`.

    The following must occur before calling this function:

        Buffer where the output is to be written.
    .. param:: size_t output_size
        Size of the ``output`` buffer in bytes. This must be appropriate for the selected algorithm and key:

        *   A sufficient output size is :code:`PSA_AEAD_UPDATE_OUTPUT_SIZE(key_type, alg, input_length)` where ``key_type`` is the type of key and ``alg`` is the algorithm that were used to set up the operation.

            See the :ref:`detailed warning <aead-multi-part-warning>`.

    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The following conditions can result in this error:

        *   The operation state is not valid: it must be active, have a nonce set, and have lengths set if required by the algorithm.
        *   The library requires initializing by a call to `psa_crypto_init()`.

    The following must occur before calling this function:

    1.  Call either `psa_aead_encrypt_setup()` or `psa_aead_decrypt_setup()`. The choice of setup function determines whether this function encrypts or decrypts its input.
    #.  Set the nonce with `psa_aead_generate_nonce()` or `psa_aead_set_nonce()`.
    #.  Call `psa_aead_update_ad()` to pass all the additional data.

    If this function returns an error status, the operation enters an error state and must be aborted by calling `psa_aead_abort()`.

    .. note::

        This function does not require the input to be aligned to any particular block boundary. If the implementation can only process a whole block at a time, it must consume all the input provided, but it might delay the end of the corresponding output until a subsequent call to `psa_aead_update()` provides sufficient input, or a subsequent call to `psa_aead_finish()` or `psa_aead_verify()` indicates the end of the input. The amount of data that can be delayed in this way is bounded by the associated output size macro: `PSA_AEAD_UPDATE_OUTPUT_SIZE()`, `PSA_AEAD_FINISH_OUTPUT_SIZE()`, or `PSA_AEAD_VERIFY_OUTPUT_SIZE()`.

    This function has two output buffers:

    *   ``ciphertext`` contains trailing ciphertext that was buffered from preceding calls to `psa_aead_update()`.

    When this function returns successfully, the operation becomes inactive. If this function returns an error status, the operation enters an error state and must be aborted by calling `psa_aead_abort()`.

    .. admonition:: Implementation note

        Implementations must make the best effort to ensure that the comparison between the actual tag and the expected tag is performed in constant time.

.. function:: psa_aead_abort

    .. summary::
        Abort an AEAD operation.

    .. param:: psa_aead_operation_t * operation
        Initialized AEAD operation.

    .. return:: psa_status_t
    .. retval:: PSA_SUCCESS
        Success.
        The operation object can now be discarded or reused.
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_CORRUPTION_DETECTED
    .. retval:: PSA_ERROR_BAD_STATE
        The library requires initializing by a call to `psa_crypto_init()`.

    Aborting an operation frees all associated resources except for the ``operation`` object itself. Once aborted, the operation object can be reused for another operation by calling `psa_aead_encrypt_setup()` or `psa_aead_decrypt_setup()` again.

    This function can be called any time after the operation object has been initialized as described in `psa_aead_operation_t`.

    In particular, calling `psa_aead_abort()` after the operation has been terminated by a call to `psa_aead_abort()`, `psa_aead_finish()` or `psa_aead_verify()` is safe and has no effect.

    .. return::
        ``1`` if ``alg`` is an AEAD algorithm which is an AEAD mode based on a block cipher, ``0`` otherwise.

        This macro can return either ``0`` or ``1`` if ``alg`` is not a supported algorithm identifier.
