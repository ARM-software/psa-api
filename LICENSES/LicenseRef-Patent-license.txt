Grant of Patent License

=======================================================================

Subject to the terms and conditions of this license (both the
CC BY-SA 4.0 Public License and this Patent License), each Licensor
hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
otherwise transfer the Licensed Material, where such license applies
only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are
necessarily infringed by their contribution(s) alone or by combination
of their contribution(s) with the Licensed Material to which such
contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Material or a contribution
incorporated within the Licensed Material constitutes direct or
contributory patent infringement, then any licenses granted to You under
this license for that Licensed Material shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed.
