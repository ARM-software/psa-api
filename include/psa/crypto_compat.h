/* This function is not a TF-PSA-Crypto API and may be removed without notice.

 * Dummy version of a function removed in
 * https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/TF-PSA-Crypto/pull/466
 *
 * The function needs to remain available during a transition period
 * for the sake of the PSA simulator, which lives in Mbed TLS.
 * Once TF-PSA-Crypto no longer needs the function,
 * `tests/psa-client-server/psasim/src/psa_sim_crypto_server.c` will
 * need to be updated to no longer need the function, and it will be
 * possible to remove the corresponding RPC call altogether.
