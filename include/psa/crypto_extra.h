/** Force an immediate reseed of the PSA random generator.
 *
 * The entropy source(s) are the ones configured at compile time.
 *
 * The random generator is always seeded automatically before use, and
 * it is reseeded as needed based on the configured policy, so most
 * applications do not need to call this function.
 *
 * The main reason to call this function is in scenarios where the process
 * state is cloned (i.e. duplicated) while the random generator is active.
 * In such scenarios, you must call this function in every clone of
 * the original process before performing any cryptographic operation
 * that uses randomness. (Note that any operation that uses a private or
 * secret key may use randomness internally even if the result is not
 * randomized, but hashing and signature verification are ok.) For example:
 *
 * - If the process is part of a live virtual machine that is cloned,
 *   call this function after cloning so that the new instance has a
 *   distinct random generator state.
 * - If the process is part of a hibernated image that may be resumed
 *   multiple times, call this function after resuming so that each
 *   resumed instance has a distinct random generator state.
 * - If the process is cloned through the fork() system call, the
 *   child process should call this function before using the random
 *   generator.
 *
 * An additional consideration applies in configurations where there is no
 * actual entropy source, only a nonvolatile seed (i.e.
 * #MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_NV_SEED and #MBEDTLS_ENTROPY_NO_SOURCES_OK are enabled,
 * and #MBEDTLS_PSA_BUILTIN_GET_ENTROPY and #MBEDTLS_PSA_DRIVER_GET_ENTROPY
 * are disabled).
 * In such configurations, simply calling psa_random_reseed() in multiple
 * cloned processes would result in the same random generator state in
 * all the clones. To avoid this, in such configurations, you must pass
 * a unique \p perso string in every clone.
 *
 * \note  This function has no effect when the compilation option
 *        #MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG is enabled.
 *
 * \note  In client-server builds, this function may not be available
 *        from clients, since the decision to reseed is generally based
 *        on the server state.
 *
 * \note  If the entropy source fails, the random generator remains usable:
 *        subsequent calls to generate random data will succeed until
 *        the random generator itself decides to reseed. If you want to
 *        force a reseed, either treat the failure as a fatal error,
 *        or call psa_random_deplete() instead of this function (or in
 *        addition).

 *                      In most cases, it is fine for \c perso to be
 *                      empty. The main use case for a personalization

 * At this point there is a cryptographic guarantee that only the authenticated

 *
 * To make the authentication explicit there are various methods, see Section 5
 * of RFC 8236 for two examples.
 *
 * \note The JPAKE implementation has the following limitations:
 *       - The only supported primitive is ECC on the curve secp256r1, i.e.
 *         `PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE(PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC,

/** The SPAKE2+ algorithm.
 *
 * SPAKE2+ is the augmented password-authenticated key exchange protocol,
 * defined by RFC9383. SPAKE2+ includes confirmation of the shared secret
 * key that results from the key exchange.
 * SPAKE2+ is required by Matter Specification, Version 1.2, as MATTER_PAKE.
 * Matter uses an earlier draft of the SPAKE2+ protocol: "SPAKE2+, an
 * Augmented PAKE (Draft 02)".
 * Although the operation of the PAKE is similar for both of these variants,
 * they have different key schedules for the derivation of the shared secret.
 *
 * When setting up a PAKE cipher suite to use the SPAKE2+ protocol defined
 * in RFC9383:
 * - For cipher-suites that use HMAC for key confirmation, use the
 *   PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P_HMAC() algorithm, parameterized by the required hash
 *   algorithm.
 * - For cipher-suites that use CMAC-AES-128 for key confirmation, use the
 *   PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P_CMAC() algorithm, parameterized by the required hash
 *   algorithm.
 * - Use a PAKE primitive for the required elliptic curve.
 * 
 * For example, the following code creates a cipher suite to select SPAKE2+
 * using edwards25519 with the SHA-256 hash function:
 *
 * \code
 * psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite = PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT;
 * psa_pake_cs_set_algorithm(cipher_suite, PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P_HMAC(PSA_ALG_SHA_256));
 * psa_pake_cs_set_primitive(&cipher_suite,
 *                           PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE(PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC,
 *                               PSA_ECC_FAMILY_TWISTED_EDWARDS, 255));
 * \endcode
 *
 * When setting up a PAKE cipher suite to use the SPAKE2+ protocol used by
 * Matter:
 * - Use the PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P_MATTER algorithm.
 * - Use the PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE(PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC,
 *                              PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_R1, 256)
 *   PAKE primitive.
 * 
 * The following code creates a cipher suite to select the Matter variant of
 * SPAKE2+:
 * 
 * \code
 * psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite = PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT;
 * psa_pake_cs_set_algorithm(&cipher_suite, PSA_ALG_SPAKE2P_MATTER);
 * psa_pake_cs_set_primitive(&cipher_suite,
 *                           PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE(PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE_TYPE_ECC,
 *                               PSA_ECC_FAMILY_SECP_R1, 256));
 * \endcode
 *
 * After initializing a SPAKE2+ operation, call
 *
 * \code
 * psa_pake_setup(operation, password, cipher_suite);
 * psa_pake_set_role(operation, ...);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * The password provided to the client side must be of type
 * #PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_KEY_PAIR.
 * The password provided to the server side must be of type
 * #PSA_KEY_TYPE_SPAKE2P_PUBLIC_KEY.
 *
 * The role set by \c psa_pake_set_role() must be either
 * \c PSA_PAKE_ROLE_CLIENT or \c PSA_PAKE_ROLE_SERVER.
 * 
 * Then provide any additional, optional parameters:
 * 
 * \code
 * psa_pake_set_user(operation, ...);
 * psa_pake_set_peer(operation, ...);
 * psa_pake_set_context(operation, ...);
 * \endcode
 * 
 *
 * The key exchange flow for a SPAKE2+ client is as follows:
 * \code
 * // send shareP
 * psa_pake_output(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
 * // receive shareV
 * psa_pake_input(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
 * // receive confirmV
 * psa_pake_input(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM, ...);
 * // send confirmP
 * psa_pake_output(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM, ...);
 * // get K_shared
 * psa_pake_get_shared_key(operation, ...);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The key exchange flow for a SPAKE2+ server is as follows:
 * \code
 * // receive shareP
 * psa_pake_input(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);
 * // send shareV
 * psa_pake_output(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...);

 * // receive confirmP
 * psa_pake_input(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM, ...);
 * // get K_shared
 * psa_pake_get_shared_key(operation, ...);
 * \endcode
 *
 * The shared secret that is produced by SPAKE2+ is pseudorandom. Although
 * it can be used directly as an encryption key, it is recommended to use
 * the shared secret as an input to a key derivation operation to produce
 * additional cryptographic keys.

 *
 * This is WPA3-SAE as defined by "IEEE Std 802.11-REVme/D7.0 2024, 
 * chapter 12.4", including the Hash-To-Element (H2E) variant.
 * It is instantiated with the following parameters:
 *
 * - The group is defined over a finite field or an elliptic curve.
 * - A cryptographic hash function.
 *
 * For WPA3-SAE selected by the AKM suites 8 and 9, use the
 * PSA_ALG_WPA3_SAE_FIXED() algorithm, parameterized by the required hash
 * algorithm.
 * For WPA3-SAE selected by the AKM suites 24 and 25 (SAE using group-dependent
 * hash), use the PSA_ALG_WPA3_SAE_GDH() algorithm, parameterized by the
 * required hash algorithm.
 * 
 * To select these parameters and set up the cipher suite, call these functions:
 *
 * \code
 * psa_pake_cipher_suite_t cipher_suite = PSA_PAKE_CIPHER_SUITE_INIT;
 * psa_pake_cs_set_algorithm(cipher_suite, PSA_ALG_WPA3_SAE_FIXED(hash));
 * psa_pake_cs_set_primitive(&cipher_suite,
 *                           PSA_PAKE_PRIMITIVE(type, family, bits));
 * \endcode
 *
 * After initializing a WPA3-SAE operation, call:
 *
 * \code
 * psa_pake_setup(operation, password, cipher_suite);
 * psa_pake_set_user(operation, ...);
 * psa_pake_set_peer(operation, ...);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * For basic SAE the password must be of type #PSA_KEY_TYPE_PASSWORD,
 * for SAE-H2E the password must be of type #PSA_KEY_TYPE_WPA3_SAE.
 *
 * \c psa_pake_set_role() must not be called because WPA3-SAE is a symmetric PAKE.
 * 
 * For a key exchange first call the following functions in any order:
 * \code
 * // send commit message
 * psa_pake_output(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_COMMIT, ...);
 * // receive commit message
 * psa_pake_input(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_COMMIT, ...);
 * \endcode
 *
 * If the Hash-To-Element variant is used and a list of rejected groups
 * is available, it must be provided as a salt:
 *
 * \code
 * // input salt
 * psa_pake_input(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_SALT, ...);
 * \endcode
 *
 * Then call the following functions in any order:
 * \code
 * // set send-confirm counter
 * psa_pake_input(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM_COUNT, ...);
 * // send confirm message
 * psa_pake_output(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM, ...);
 * // receive confirm message
 * psa_pake_input(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM, ...);
 * // get key id (optional)
 * psa_pake_output(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_ID, ...);
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Remarks:
 * \c psa_pake_input(#PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM_COUNT) must be called before
 * \c psa_pake_output(#PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM) to set the send-confirm counter.
 * The #PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM_COUNT and #PSA_PAKE_STEP_CONFIRM steps may be used
 * multiple times to handle repeated confirm messages with varying counts.
 *
 * Finally get the shared secret: 
 *
 * \code
 * // get secret
 * psa_pake_get_shared_key();
 * \endcode
 *
 * The shared secret produced by WPA3-SAE is pseudorandom.
 * It can be used directly as an encryption key or as input to a key derivation
 * operation.

 * The sequence of operations to set up a password-authenticated key exchange

 * -# Allocate a PAKE operation object which will be passed to all the functions

 * -# Initialize the operation object with one of the methods described in the
 *    documentation for #psa_pake_operation_t. For example, using
 *    #PSA_PAKE_OPERATION_INIT.
 * -# Call #psa_pake_setup() to specify the cipher suite.
 * -# Call \c psa_pake_set_xxx() functions on the operation to complete the
 *    setup. The exact sequence of \c psa_pake_set_xxx() functions that needs
 *    to be called depends on the algorithm in use.
 *
 * A typical sequence of calls to perform a password-authenticated key
 * exchange:
 * -# Call #psa_pake_output(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...) to get the
 *    key share that needs to be sent to the peer.
 * -# Call #psa_pake_input(operation, #PSA_PAKE_STEP_KEY_SHARE, ...) to provide
 *    the key share that was received from the peer.
 * -# Depending on the algorithm additional calls to #psa_pake_output() and
 *    #psa_pake_input() might be necessary.
 * -# Call #psa_pake_get_shared_key() to access the shared secret.
 *
 * Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE algorithms for details on the
 * required set up and operation for each algorithm, and for constraints on the
 * format and content of valid passwords. See PAKE algorithms.
 *
 * After a successful call to #psa_pake_setup(), the operation is active, and
 * the application must eventually terminate the operation. The following events
 * terminate an operation:
 * - A successful call to #psa_pake_get_shared_key().
 * - A call to #psa_pake_abort().
 *
 * If #psa_pake_setup() returns an error, the operation object is unchanged. If

/** Extract the shared secret from the PAKE as a key.
 *
 * This is the final call in a PAKE operation, which retrieves the shared
 * secret as a key. It is recommended that this key is used as an input to
 * a key derivation operation to produce additional cryptographic keys. For
 * some PAKE algorithms, the shared secret is also suitable for use as a key
 * in cryptographic operations such as encryption. Refer to the documentation
 * of individual PAKE algorithms for more information, see PAKE algorithms.
 *
 * Depending on the key confirmation requested in the cipher suite,
 * #psa_pake_get_shared_key() must be called either before or after the
 * key-confirmation output and input steps for the PAKE algorithm. The key
 * confirmation affects the guarantees that can be made about the shared key:
 *
 * Unconfirmed key:
 *
 * If the cipher suite used to set up the operation requested an unconfirmed
 * key, the application must call #psa_pake_get_shared_key() after the
 * key-exchange output and input steps are completed. The PAKE algorithm
 * provides a cryptographic guarantee that only a peer who used the same
 * password and identity inputs is able to compute the same key. However,
 * there is no guarantee that the peer is the participant it claims to be
 * and was able to compute the same key.
 *
 * Since the peer is not authenticated, no action should be taken that assumes
 * that the peer is who it claims to be. For example, do not access restricted
 * resources on the peer’s behalf until an explicit authentication has succeeded.
 *
 * \note Some PAKE algorithms do not enable the output of the shared secret
 * until it has been confirmed.
 *
 * Confirmed key:
 *
 * If the cipher suite used to set up the operation requested a confirmed key,
 * the application must call #psa_pake_get_shared_key() after the key-exchange
 * and key-confirmation output and input steps are completed.
 *
 * Following key confirmation, the PAKE algorithm provides a cryptographic
 * guarantee that the peer used the same password and identity inputs, and
 * has computed the identical shared secret key.
 *
 * Since the peer is not authenticated, no action should be taken that assumes
 * that the peer is who it claims to be. For example, do not access restricted
 * resources on the peer’s behalf until an explicit authentication has succeeded.
 *
 * \note Some PAKE algorithms do not include any key-confirmation steps.
 *
 * The exact sequence of calls to perform a password-authenticated key exchange
 * depends on the algorithm in use. Refer to the documentation of individual PAKE
 * algorithms for more information. See PAKE algorithms.
 *
 * When this function returns successfully, the operation becomes inactive. If this
 * function returns an error status, the operation enters an error state and must
 * be aborted by calling #psa_pake_abort().
 *
 * \param[in,out]   operation   Active PAKE operation.
 * \param[in]       attributes  The attributes for the new key. This function uses
 *                              the attributes as follows:
 *                              The key type is required. All PAKE algorithms can
 *                              output a key of type #PSA_KEY_TYPE_DERIVE or
 *                              #PSA_KEY_TYPE_HMAC. PAKE algorithms that produce a
 *                              pseudo-random shared secret, can also output
 *                              block-cipher key types, for example
 *                              #PSA_KEY_TYPE_AES. Refer to the documentation of
 *                              individual PAKE algorithms for more information.
 *                              See PAKE algorithms.
 *
 *                              The key size in attributes must be zero. The
 *                              returned key size is always determined from the
 *                              PAKE shared secret.
 *
 *                              The key permitted-algorithm policy is required for
 *                              keys that will be used for a cryptographic operation.
 *
 *                              The key usage flags define what operations are permitted
 *                              with the key.
 *
 *                              The key lifetime and identifier are required for a
